I was looking to replace my usual perfume when I came across this one on Amazon. It caught my attention because it was a top choice and it was super affordable. My previous perfumes cost an average of $50-$80. I was skeptical at first but I saw so many positive reviews. I've never bought a Middle Eastern product before, but I'm glad I did because I absolutely love this scent 💯. It has such an amazing aroma: a sweet floral and vanilla scent that feels light and feminine. The scent lingers on your clothes and doesn't vanish quickly. It's long-lasting and smells luxurious. Best of all, it was super affordable. I'm going to try the other scents. ♥️♥️👌"

It smells fresh, clean, and floral but it’s not overpowering. It’s perfect for everyday. It does remind me of like a spring/summer fragrance but I will definitely wear anytime. I do notice that it doesn't last as long as some of my other perfumes but I apply it after my lotion and it pairs really well. It's good for layering too. I also use it in my hair on days I use other perfumes and it works perfectly."

Works well if you layer up with something stronger or with a little more body. I do notice the fragrance fades quickly. Works like a body splash for me."

It has this soft floral scent with a hint of vanilla, and it's long-lasting. It's light enough to be used on a daily basis, but I will probably use it for special occasions. Don't run, but walk ladies, you won't regret it :)"

I was honestly scared to buy perfume online not knowing firsthand what it would smell like, but I am so glad I purchased this perfume! I have no specific words to describe the smell, but if I had to choose, I would say the perfume smells very feminine, clean, refreshing, yet intoxicating! It reminds me of a raspberry scent, and I would totally buy again. The quality of the perfume makes the price worth it, and it feels very fancy to own something so simple, knowing you’ll smell good whenever it’s put to use!"

The only thing that was “wrong” was that my perfume had a small scuff on it but I don’t mind that still 5 stars for me! (The scuff is on the second photo, very small and hard to see)"
1;"Fragrance";"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C8VNWBP";NA;18930;8;"Verified Purchase";3;2024-06-06;"United States";"english";4;"My honest opinion okay so I do like this fragrance, it does smell a lot like the sold spray (the vanilla caramel and pistachio one) but I like this better than that. It doesn't smell as yogurty. It doesn't smell like strawberry milk like people think it does idk where that is coming from maybe smelling something I am not. But this is really sweet and does have a hint of fruity but I mean a tiny hint. It is a solid vanilla scented perfume and it lasts a long time like 6+ on me if you sniff your arm but does last a while. Like definitely worth the price just for that alone. The bottle is gorgeous and packaging too. I do recommend this for girlies who love vanilla scented sprays who also enjoy the sold stuff. I do wonder if the smell will change as it sits. But overall it's a nice fragrance."
1;"Fragrance";"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C8VNWBP";NA;18930;9;"Verified Purchase";4;2024-07-19;"United States";"english";5;"Love this perfume! I loved this perfume. This was a blind purchase but I don't regret it. You can definitely smell the tropical notes and gourmand but also a powdery smell that even though I'm not a fan of, it balances perfectly with the other notes. Some say it smells like a strawberry milkshake and I honestly didn't find any of that. It has good projection but nothing crazy. Maybe it depends on your pH. On me, it lasts between 6 to 7 hours. But compared to other perfumes I own that cost more, I say this is not bad at all and you can layer it with a body mist or body oil to make it last longer as I did. Overall a good purchase. Only complaint is that packaging did not come in perfect condition. Aside from that, I totally recommend it."

But I read the reviews and read all about the notes and secondary notes a.k.a. different scents of this perfume, and it is absolutely yummy smelling absolutely beautiful… so feminine! I could go on and on and on because I know everybody has a different smell when they spray perfumes, but have to say next to my signature scent Ralph Lauren Romance, this is going to be my go-to perfume!!!!"

It’s like a slightly fruity, floral gourmand. It does not smell like strawberry milk like some people are saying, but it smells so good! It’s a very feminine scent. I wore it to a concert last night where it was super hot and sweaty, and then I went home and took a shower, and I could still smell the perfume! The perfume also smells more expensive than $22, it’s a very good perfume and for the price it’s just one of the best things you could purchase!"

I read reviews and figured I would try it. I absolutely love it and got compliments on how nice I smell. I ordered two more sets of three and got rid of all the other fragrances I have. This will be my number one now."

The only thing I can say is the projection isn’t there until someone gets close enough to smell it. I smelled it on myself for about 5 hours before I reapplied it because I wasn’t receiving enough compliments on my new scent 🤣 Call me crazy, but one of the best compliments isn’t how beautiful you are but instead how well I smell 🥰 The girls that get it just get it. But yes, honey, snag it for your collection if you’re in love with scents like I am."

I get so many compliments when I wear this, it’s ridiculous. My family member smelled it and immediately asked me to buy one for them. They wore it to a family event and another family member asked them where they got it so they could order too! This is definitely worth the money. It’s a warm, sweet smell, more on the lighter end, and it lasts all day."
1;"Fragrance";"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C8VNWBP";NA;18930;15;"Verified Purchase";1;2024-07-28;"United States";"english";4;"Honest review: I was easily influenced by this TikTok viral perfume, so I had to try it. First, I must say, it comes in a lovely packaging and a beautiful bottle design. When you first spray it, it gives a Black Opium perfume vibe. The fragrance smells like strawberries and cream with a little hint of musk, very subtle though. But so far, I can barely smell it... I would recommend this perfume after showering or before going to bed. Wore it and got zero compliments. 😴"

I was swayed to purchase this scent after seeing so many people post on the Lemon8 app about it. I was looking to try something other than my typical go-to scent (Juicy Couture) and I’m happy I gave it a go. It has a soft feminine scent that is not overpowering but long-lasting. I’m happy with this purchase and I can’t wait to try others."

I was in the casino a couple of weeks ago and our server smelled so good. I asked, and she said it was the perfume. Now I've seen this bottle on Amazon many times, read all the reviews, and was still skeptical. But when our server told me what it was, I added it to my cart, still waited, and finally bought it. Well, it came today! Baybayyyy, this perfume is beautiful! I will buy it again!"

I don’t normally wear perfumes that get compliments but I got three compliments one night at work and was pleasantly surprised by this. It has a lovely floral and light citrusy scent to it. It can be strong if you apply a lot, but a few spritzes really go a long way."

I bought it because, well, it was $27 and worth a shot. I’m not normally a sweet/vanilla fragrance gal - give me all the earthy musks. But this blew me away, it’s definitely fluffy and sweet; like fruity, creamy, vanilla but some of the base notes like sandalwood and musk balance it so well. If you are on the fence I definitely would recommend, such an affordable gem!"
1;"Fragrance";"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C8VNWBP";NA;18930;22;"Verified Purchase";0;2024-07-31;"United States";"english";4;"It’s light and powdery so it’s a nice light fragrance, it does smell powdery. It has a subtle strawberry, for me it’s a nice fragrance but it reminds me of a strawberry shortcake scent for a small child. It does seem to last and not irritate my skin as I did spray it on my forearm, it didn’t last on my cotton shirt however."

I usually mix it with a Victoria's Secret body mist. It is very long-lasting and even lingers on your clothes after a wash. It smells more of a rosy smell than vanilla though."

Let me start by telling you that I am Middle Eastern and I love our perfumes. This has nothing to do with Middle Eastern perfumes, it’s more of a European, summertime, girly perfume dupe. It’s very fresh but it has a scent that I don’t like. Overall, it’s not bad but not worth the hype. It’s more of a college girl perfume or a splash, and it’s not long-lasting either. The appearance and bottle are great and don’t leak. The bottle is very durable. Overall, I like it but will not purchase again."

Lattafa Yara is a disappointing fragrance that fails to live up to its exotic branding. The scent is overpowering and artificial, lacking the subtlety and complexity one would expect from a quality perfume. It tends to linger in an unpleasant way, and the notes clash rather than harmonize. The packaging, while attractive, doesn’t make up for the lackluster product inside. For a fragrance that aims to make a statement, Lattafa Yara delivers the wrong message entirely."

I love this perfume, it smells so good, one of my favorite perfumes in my collection so far. You don't need to spray a lot because, trust me, the smell will be there all day.

I like to spray my good vanilla perfume on my skin and this on my clothes. (It makes it last a little longer) This smells so good. I wish it lasted longer on me."

The media could not be loaded. I am absolutely in love with Versace Bright Crystal! From the moment I opened the beautifully designed box, I knew I was in for a treat. The bottle itself is a piece of art – elegant and sophisticated, perfectly capturing the essence of the fragrance within. The scent is a delightful blend that feels both fresh and clean, yet luxuriously classy. It's perfect for any occasion, whether you're heading to a formal event or just want to feel special on a regular day. It is sweet and floral with the perfect balance that is both light and captivating without being overpowering. I prefer to have a light and airy scent and this hits every point. What I appreciate most about Versace Bright Crystal is its versatility. It transitions seamlessly from day to night, making it a staple in my collection. Every time I wear it, I receive compliments and inquiries about what perfume I'm wearing. It truly makes me feel confident and elegant. If you're looking for a fragrance that combines beauty, class, and a fresh, clean scent, look no further than Versace Bright Crystal. It has become my go-to perfume, and I cannot recommend it enough. This is a must-have for anyone who loves to feel luxurious and sophisticated every day!"

I've tested this a few times with my husband, and so far every time I've worn it, he can't keep his hands off me. All he knows about it is that it's one of my new fragrances and that he likes it.

The perfume is fairly strong and lasts at least through an entire workday. The scent is not working for me. When opening the bottle, I was hit with a heavy, powdery, and floral smell. Upon application to my arms, there was a minty smell added to the powdered floral scent. All three scents competed with each other for the next several hours, giving me a headache while creating a cloud of smell around me. After about 6 hours, it died down enough to not be overpowering and allowed the sandalwood, amber, and a hint of vanilla to shine while also calming the powdery musk scent. As for its effects, I don't know. I have used the original and it worked incredibly well, so theoretically, this one should work too. I just haven't used it around others because of how strong it is."

Wow, I absolutely love this perfume. This has become my new go-to for day-to-day wear, and I wear it on every single date. I can't say for certain if the pheromones really have an effect, but wearing this definitely makes me feel more confident because I know I smell so good. I have had multiple partners over the last 6 months comment on how good I smell (one even told me that my skin just smelled so amazing and he thought it was just the way I smelled). Don't expect people to magically come up to you because you're wearing this perfume, but smelling good definitely doesn't hurt and the scent of this lasts for a really long time. It's also the perfect size to stick in your purse or pocket so you can take it and reapply throughout the evening if need be. Literally cannot recommend enough."

I also notice that I get a scratchy throat and have to clear my throat at first wear. But I also have the same reaction to candles and wax melts. It must have to do with the oils. So if candles and wax melts don't affect you, this probably won’t either."

All the videos on Instagram show the guy literally almost devouring the female who’s wearing the scent. My husband did not notice it whatsoever. This scent almost smells 100% exactly like Bitter Peach from Tom Ford, which I have. So maybe I didn’t get the reaction because I already have a scent that smells identical to this. I’m gonna try a different one and see what happens."

It's super addicting even I can't stop smelling my own wrist. My husband sitting on the bed noticed the smell right away & told me, \What's that smell?\ I told him it's my new perfume I ordered. He complimented it, saying it smells super nice. Of course, I smiled all proud because I was in complete shock; he noticed it so quickly without me telling him first. I wanted to put it to the test since everyone on TikTok was raving all about this perfume oil. So, I wore it to the Fresno Hmong New Year. - Overall experience, no one came up to me! Which was a bummer because I'm starting to doubt this perfume. I had my makeup, hair, and complete traditional outfit on too. The only thing that happened was a few men (from mid-28-og) were concerned for me and asked if I was okay. For all my ladies out there wearing heels will understand, I was at the Hmong New Year for 5 hours & couldn't walk in heels anymore, so of course, I took them off and walked barefoot around the festival. :) The true definition of beauty is pain. My thoughts on this product: ~ It doesn't make men go too crazy like on social media. ~ Must apply every time once the smell starts to abate. I apply every 2 hours. ~ It does make you feel super confident & in your feminine energy after you apply it. The smell is similar to those Victoria's Secret perfumes, but the only difference is Pure Instinct has pheromones, which attracts people while Victoria's Secret perfume doesn't have. *** For all my ladies: Men are attracted to sweet & delicate scents, so if you're debating on buying this product, I say purchase it right away & put it to your knowledge. Everyone has their own certain unique smell, so the experience will be different from mine. Not only is this oil delightful in smell, it gives off a sexual arousal. Even I was quite turned on while applying this on. ***"

I stumbled upon a small bottle that performed like a charm – alas, it's now a relic of the past. (It is now discontinued but was from an Amazon company called Healthy Vibes.) Hence, I embarked on a quest for a worthy successor and settled for this roll-on variant. While it does the job adequately, it lacks the sheer magic of its predecessor. The scent is pleasant, yet I lack concrete evidence of its pheromonal prowess, unlike the previous elixir that yielded tangible results. With the former, a mere spritz invoked attention I hadn't known possible. There was this one memorable encounter – post our horizontal escapade, she caught a whiff of my neck, likening it to the aroma of freshly baked bread. Instantly, her arousal surged, reigniting our passion without delay. Such is the power of a well-crafted scent! Funny stories aside, this Pure Instinct pheromone cologne is a very nice addition to my nightlife escapades. Though it hasn't shown the same effect as the latter, it's still a nice smell, and I like to wear it from time to time."

I applied this 3 times; twice when I was about to go to bed, then once in the morning. I did notice that hubby at first rolled closer to my side of the bed, but I think because we were so tired, nothing transpired. I know pheromones work with the chemicals in your existing pH and hormones, and because I am currently menstruating, maybe that has something to do with it not working on him at this time? (I’m a nurse, but I’m not sure how this works tbh). Early this morning, I reapplied, and he didn’t notice. Zip. Nada. He held my hand and was playful, but nothing out of the ordinary. Lol, maybe his olfactory nerves are shot. Hahahaha. I gave it 4 stars because of the scent itself. It has a wonderfully pleasant and warm sweet vanilla aroma, with a hint of citrus. Nothing too overpowering. Over time, the scent fades and sort of adjusts to your own. It’s really nice. About to hit the gym with my husband, with the pheromone perfume still on…so tbd. We’ll see if I get compliments. Edited to add: I’m off my period and used it again. Hubby has been a tiny bit more affectionate with me. When I hit the gym, someone shyly came up to me and asked when I would be done with my set. Then it just seemed like a decent amount of guys flocked near me (about 3-4, and I think a couple of them were gym buddies). None of them spoke to me (I’m sure seeing my wedding band may have turned them off), but they stuck around until I was done lifting dumbbells. They scattered soon after I left. On the train, a guy kept staring at me. Very creepy, as he would smoke his cigarette then stare. I just kept scrolling on my phone until my stop came, and was glad we had different stops. When I got home, hubby was his same usual self, but in bed, he kept trying to touch me even if I wasn’t exactly in the mood! Hahahaha. Maybe I just needed to be off my period for it to work."

I never told my husband I purchased this. I put it on immediately after opening. Applying it to my wrists, behind my ears, between my breasts, behind my knees, and in the creases where my arms bend. It sounds like a lot, but very minimal amounts were applied. I let it sit and absorb into my skin, and it was a very warm, fall/winter scent on me. I know it depends on your pH levels, etc., for the way it smells on each person and when. But the minute my husband was around me, he could not keep his hands off me!!! He kept saying how good I smelled, kissing me, and well…you can guess what happened later on lol. He is typically not like this at all, so it took me by surprise! I decided to wear it out while running errands and had several men opening doors for me, standing close to me, and even telling me how good I smelled!

I've purchased this 9 times with my last purchase being Oct 2023. I noticed that in my second to last purchase, the formula was different with a very different scent, which I find to be more masculine. The feminine undertones were missing. I thought maybe this was a packaging issue and I received a different scent, so I purchased again to be disappointed because it was still the masculine scent. I miss the old formula and would purchase it again and again if it changed back. Maybe I'll try again in a few months to see if I get lucky. Since then, I've been using the Pure Romance brand, which is okay..."

Shortly after, I took it out with me in my bag on a night out. My bag was stolen that night with all of my contents... I wonder if my great scent is what lured the burglar to me... I repurchased this perfume in the following months after the scowl finally wore off of my face from my prior experience. Still smells great! Woo! The roller is a bit abrasive on the skin of my neck but... it's fine... Oops ... no it isn't apparently. I put it on my neck Friday night, and maybe it's because I used several passes of the scent on my flesh, but I broke into a horrible bumpy rash on my entire neck up into my ears and hairline, 360⁰. It burns, it itches, I am reading ancient stories of our creation from the Braille novels on my skin... It's been almost a week and the rash has not subsided. Very sad and disappointed as I will now never use this product on my neck again which was really the only place that mattered for me. RIP."

So this perfume is definitely very unique and very interesting. When I first unpackaged it and smelled the bottle, it was definitely a strong, musky smell that almost smelled like pine... but after I put it on and rubbed it in (and sat with it for a few minutes) it definitely became more of a sweeter, lighter smell. This is definitely an intimate perfume that does smell nice if you're the type to like those kinds of things, but do I think it will attract your boyfriend, girlfriend, or spouse? No. I think that all the hype around this perfume is just the sellers convincing us that it will make us more attractive. With that being said, I think that when we apply this perfume it gives us a confidence boost which (might) make us more attractive in some way. This product was well packaged and is a fairly decent size, and it is a full bottle when you first get it."

Okay, so I purchased this, and I'll be honest, I'm not sure. I enjoy the scent; it's pretty and spicy, and I am very picky about scents. I have received a lot of compliments and people asking me what I'm wearing since purchasing it. I even had a random lady stop me in the grocery store to tell me I smelled good and asked what I was wearing. It was very flattering. However, I layer it with other scents, so I don't think the compliments are on this alone. Also, all of the compliments have almost exclusively been from other women. Lastly, my significant other has shown zero increased interest or heightened sexual attraction, which was the purpose of me ordering it. I still enjoy it and wear it often."

It doesn’t last as long as the actual perfume, but that is typical of a body spray vs a perfume. It’s 9 times out of 10 not going to be as concentrated.

I love this smell. To me, it reminds me of powdered sugar. Like, I feel like that’s what it smells like. Or maybe it smells like how powdered sugar tastes. I don’t remember if powdered sugar has a smell or not, but I love it so much. It also kinda smells like water, if that makes sense. But not in a bad way. It doesn’t smell like water as in it doesn’t smell like anything, but the smell of water definitely helps add to the scent in my opinion. Strong alcohol smell upon spraying but dissipates very fast. Really long-lasting fragrance in my opinion. I did buy this for $40, which is a little insane for just a body spray. I'm assuming the price is much lower now because they re-released this scent in VS. But still worth it at $40 anyway. Best fragrance out there, nothing even comes close."

It doesn’t last as long as I would like, like my Lucky You or my Into the Night does or my Oakcha Sinful does but for something light that isn’t too strong this might be perfect for you! As far as if you want something that is strong and long-lasting this is not the perfume to buy. I love the smell and all but I noticed if you want it smelling longer or stronger you literally have to put like 20 or 30 sprays on yourself and I’m just not doing that so I will start investing in my name brand perfumes again that I know are worth more money because I know those will last me all day and have better quality!!

The cost is more than most fragrance sprays, but this one is worth it. You will not be disappointed with this one."

Here’s why this scent deserves a full five-star rating: Fresh and invigorating scent: The first thing that strikes you about Nautica Voyage is its incredibly fresh and invigorating scent. The fruity top notes of apple are perfectly balanced with the aquatic notes of water lotus, creating a crisp and clean aroma that is both refreshing and uplifting. It's an ideal fragrance for daytime wear, giving you a boost of confidence and energy. Subtle yet romantic: What sets this fragrance apart is its subtle romantic undertone. The heart notes of water lotus and cedarwood add a gentle woody aroma that gives the scent a warm and inviting feel. This combination makes it not only suitable for casual wear but also for more intimate, romantic occasions. Long-lasting and effective: Despite being an Eau de Toilette, Nautica Voyage has impressive longevity. A few sprays in the morning last well into the afternoon, making it a reliable choice for busy days. The scent evolves beautifully over time, starting with the fresh fruity notes and gradually settling into the deeper woody and musky base notes of cedarwood and musk. Versatile and adaptable: This fragrance’s versatility is one of its strongest points. It’s light enough for office wear, yet sophisticated enough for a dinner date. Whether you're heading to a meeting, a casual outing, or a romantic evening, Nautica Voyage adapts to the occasion seamlessly.

It’s also a generous size, providing excellent value for money. Conclusion: Nautica Voyage Eau de Toilette for men is a masterfully crafted fragrance that perfectly balances fresh, fruity notes with warm, woody undertones. Its versatility, longevity, and appealing scent make it a standout choice for any man. Whether for daily wear or special occasions, this fragrance is a winner. Highly recommended for anyone looking to add a touch of freshness and romance to their daily routine."

It stands out as a pleasant cologne in its own right. While I’m not particularly fond of fruity fragrances, Nautica Voyage’s fruity notes are well-balanced and become subtler after the dry down. I do wish it had a touch more citrus to complement its marine elements better. Citrus scents tend to enhance freshness, which could elevate the overall profile. However, given its price, Nautica Voyage is incredibly economical. It’s the most affordable cologne per ounce in my collection, making it a practical choice. I’d give it 4 stars primarily for its value and performance. It’s perfect for quick errands during warmer months and holds up well throughout the day. My wife appreciates its fresh appeal, although I reserve it for occasions where its fruitiness is less pronounced. Overall, Nautica Voyage EDT is a solid option for those seeking a fresh and budget-friendly fragrance."

Ahoy, fragrance enthusiasts! Nautica Voyage has sailed into my life, and let me tell you, it's been quite the journey. I feel like a dapper sailor every time I spritz it on—fresh, clean, and ready to conquer the high seas (or at least the grocery store). First whiff? A delightful breeze of apple and green leaves, like a picnic in a coastal orchard. It’s invigorating and makes me feel like I'm starring in my own yacht commercial. The scent is light, refreshing, and perfect for those who want to smell like they’ve just stepped off a luxury sailboat. But here’s the thing—Nautica Voyage isn’t for everyone. My buddy Dave tried it and said he felt like he was drowning in a sea of cucumbers. My other friend, Jenny, claimed it smelled like someone dumped a fruit salad in her gym bag. To each their own, I suppose! And let’s talk longevity. It lasts longer than I expected, which is great for me but might not be so great if you’re stuck in an elevator with someone who isn’t a fan of oceanic adventures. One coworker commented that I smelled like a wet forest, which I choose to take as a compliment, though I’m not entirely sure it was. So, if you're ready for a voyage of your own and don’t mind a few waves of cucumber and apple, Nautica Voyage might just be your new first mate. But fair warning: it’s smooth sailing for some and choppy waters for others! Anchors away! 🚢"

This smells really clean, fresh out of the shower type of vibe. I think it's perfect for daily casual wear. Not too strong, lasts around 3-4 hours for me (could be a bit noseblind to it though). Just a very subtle clean smell. I wear it to work, running errands, or just casual everyday settings, and it's perfect. I don't feel bad about using it at the price point. $20 and you've got a daily scent. The bottle will last at least 6 months or so, can't beat it. I'm sure there are stronger and maybe better similar scents out there if you want the best of the best, but they'll all be over $100 when this is only $20 and does the job."

I never used this scent before, but I decided to buy it because my granddaughter loves pink and I use it under my candle warmer. The candle is a pretty pink, not my decor, but I didn’t buy it for that. I put it under my candle warmer and it is a very subtle scent. I wish it had a stronger smell, as it is a different smell than I usually buy. The description says floral, but it really has more of a citrus smell. I don’t think I would purchase this scent again as I like a stronger scent and that is why I buy Yankee candles, they usually have a stronger scent in the room."

With an impressive burn time of over 110 hours, it ensures lasting enjoyment. These candles are not only fragrant but also beautifully packaged in a decorative glass jar with a lid, making them an excellent gift for any occasion. However, I encountered a minor issue: the candle didn’t burn all the way to the bottom. A few ounces remained unreachable, frustratingly out of reach for a regular lighter. My recommendation? Invest in a utility lighter. When the candle burns down closer to the bottom, this handy tool allows you to reach the wick without struggling. After all, there’s nothing worse than a partially used candle that can’t be relit! I also wish it were a bit stronger since the aroma is milder than I expected. 🕯️💡"

I've been purchasing Yankee Candles for years now. Why? Their scents are strong and don't smell waxy. The candle itself lasts a very long time. You can purchase the cheap 3 for $10 candles at Michaels, but they don't have the strong lasting scent nor do they burn for long. The wax in these doesn't puddle up around the wick, a common problem with some candles. This causes the flame to be extinguished. When the candle burns down too low to light anymore, I use a candle/coffee warmer to continue to enjoy the scent for many more days. I have a supply of these candles on hand at all times and will always buy them."

I recently purchased the Capri Blue Volcano scented candle, and it has quickly become my absolute favorite. From the moment I opened the stylish packaging, I knew I was in for a treat. The scent of this candle is absolutely divine. The volcano fragrance is a perfect blend of tropical fruits, sugared oranges, lemons, and limes, creating a refreshing and uplifting aroma that fills the room without being overpowering. It's the kind of scent that instantly transports you to a tropical paradise, making it ideal for creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The burn time of this candle is impressive. Despite its compact size, it burns evenly and lasts for a long time. I appreciate the clean and steady flame, which adds to the overall ambiance. The quality of the wax is excellent, leaving no residue on the glass jar. Speaking of the jar, the design is simple yet elegant. The beautiful blue color complements any decor, and the subtle label adds a touch of sophistication. The lid is a nice touch, helping to preserve the fragrance when the candle is not in use. While the price point may be a bit higher than some other candles on the market, the quality and fragrance of the Capri Blue Volcano scented candle make it well worth the investment. It's a luxurious addition to my home, and I'll definitely be purchasing more in the future. If you're looking for a high-quality candle with an amazing fragrance, look no further than Capri Blue's Volcano candle – you won't be disappointed!"

It’s a candle. It smells good. These guys are asking for a review…and I couldn’t just give the thing five stars and move on. Nope…I’m required to write an essay?! Of course they want more than a simple stars rating situation. Here it goes… When I first received the candle…my heart almost beat out of my chest with pure elation. I held back the tears of joy as I tore open the Amazon box. As I ripped into the box…I stopped. I had to take a moment to emotionally prepare myself for the greatness of the new Volcano candle. I had wept for days after burning the last bit of my old Volcano candle. The old container had sat there on my desk…empty…cold…gently citrus scented and devoid of the sweet soft wax that glowed so gently from the jar. “Why?!?!” I cried to the sky. “Why did it have to burn out so soon?!” I had fallen to the floor…collapsing in sadness and regret, knowing that my last precious moments with the old candle were spent watching Tennessee beat Alabama on the SEC Network. I’d never forget that precious moment. The light flickered slowly and burned out as the Tennessee Volunteers carried the goal posts down to the Tennessee River. I sat there in my office…watching ESPN…editing audio for Halloween drops on the radio station where I work…melancholy…mourning the loss of my friend…the Capri Blue Volcano candle. In my sadness…I turned to Amazon and ordered a replacement. So…there I was…opening my replacement candle. I slowly removed the box remnants…delicately pulled out my candle lighter…and gently lit the wick. Tears filled my eyes as I pondered my life choices…my meaning in the great vastness of the universe and the ease of ordering a candle…without stepping one foot inside of a brick and mortar store. This is truly what dreams are made of. Thank you…thank you…thank you. It’s all I’ve ever wanted. My only regret is that I could never repay the joy that this candle has given me. The end."

The second one is better! Well, I suppose there's a first time for everything. I ordered this candle after some co-workers were raving about the scent but due to the price, I went with the small tin to make sure that I liked it before ordering a larger size. When the candle was delivered, I opened it almost immediately so that I could burn it in my home office. I was a little surprised by the inadequate packing as it was only in a little plastic bag and then, much to my surprise, my candle was already burned to almost nothing! I'm assuming that someone used it and then returned it and there was little/no quality control in place to prevent it from being sent to someone else. I immediately ordered a new one as a replacement and it has arrived. You can see in my picture that I've included the replacement and also the first one that was used. Shaking my head a bit. As for the new candle, I do, in fact, love the scent. It's strong enough to fill my smaller office with a nice fragrance and it comes in the cutest little tin. It does burn a bit fast so I don't think it'll last too long but I will completely enjoy it as long as it lasts. I'm just not particularly happy that I have to go through the hassle of returning the very used product that I originally received within the next couple of weeks or I'll be charged for both. If not for this issue, I would have easily given 4+ stars."

I am an avid lover of candles and I treat and care for them very well. I keep my wicks trimmed properly and I burn them correctly, making sure to liquefy the entire top layer of wax so I do not get memory rings. The first burn is the most important. There are several factors to think about when deciding if a candle will be a great fit for you. The scent is the most important factor for me, and the linger factor is very important too. Secondly, a candle needs to burn evenly. Another very important factor is how long it lasts; I want something that is worth the price tag. I also want a candle that doesn't have that waxy smell or smoky smell. I like a lead-free wick whenever possible. I take all these factors into consideration when I rate a candle. Scent - I find that scent is truly a matter of personal preference and therefore this is the one area that is kind of a matter of personal taste. Some people like fruity scents or floral smells. Some enjoy tropical or food or fruit-related scents and so on and so on. Some people love a strong scented candle, others like something delicate. Where some candles really beat out others is the linger factor; it does not matter if the candle is delicate or strong, it should linger. A good candle's scent will still linger hours after you light it. I feel like some people will rate a candle poorly based on a non-understanding of scent styles and expectations. You cannot expect a delicate scented candle to fill an entire living room; something like that may be good for a relaxing bath or just to scent the bathroom. If you want a candle that can scent a large room, go for a scent style that is strong. With all these things touched upon, here is my review of the Aspen Bay Jar Volcano Candle. This Volcano Candle's scent is delicate yet sensual and it feels invigorating and is unique. I use this as a good bath candle; it creates a spa-like feel when I bathe. If you want something to fill a large living room, this is not that candle unless you burn two at once and place them on different ends of the room. People who smelled this in a store say it's strong, but that is because they burn several of them at once in stores so they really hit you. I find that this candle has a delicate citrus scent and I enjoy it most in a small intimate space. The actual burn - this candle does not burn evenly at all. It does not matter how well you care for it, and trust me I know how to care for candles. It's not the worst, but it does have a layer that just will not burn. The good thing is, it does not have a smoky or waxy smell, and that's a plus, and it does have a long shelf time because it is a large candle and it is a quality candle. My overall wrap-up - I gave this 3 stars because it does last and it is attractive, it does not have a waxy smell, and although I prefer a much stronger scent, it's nice for a bath and the citrus scent is unique. I didn't give 5 stars because it does not burn evenly, and that's a bummer. I hope this review helps. If you have questions, I am happy to answer them. You can view my review of this candle on YouTube sharee1982."

These are my favorite candles. The scent is fresh and clean, not overwhelming. I use mine in the bathrooms and you can even smell a bit when not burning if the lid is off. I don't like candles that smell like food. If you want it to last longer, trim the wicks after each use. I love to have these on hand for a hostess gift."

I have been considering this candle for a while now, and when I found out they had a mini size, I thought it was the perfect time to try it out at a lower cost. I had high hopes, and unfortunately, maybe they were a little too high. The scent itself is okay, but I don't think it's anything unique or something to obsess over. It does smell stronger than a diffuser, plugin, or some other types of products, but it's no stronger than most other candles on the market (lit or unlit). My biggest gripe is that the wick is too short. The wick ended with about 1/3 of the candle still left in the container. I've only seen such short wicks in really cheap candles (I actually just had the same issue with a $5 3-wick candle from Walmart, which ended with about 1/3 of the candle left, too), so it was disappointing that this expensive candle (even if it was mini size) has that issue. I thought the container was cute enough, so I poured boiling water into it and then dumped the rest of the wax (once it was liquid). There was a ton of wax left in there (probably enough to make about two tealight candles). This is probably an okay luxury gift candle to give to someone as a housewarming gift or something, but there are definitely cheaper (and better) options out there. I won't be purchasing the full size due to the risk of the short wick issue and having so much wasted wax."

As an aficionado of scented candles, I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the Chesapeake Bay Candle PT31905 scented candle, and I must say, it left an indelible impression. Here's my comprehensive review: Scent: The aroma of this candle is nothing short of enchanting. Its fragrance, described as a blend of calming lavender and refreshing sea salt, transports you to a serene seaside retreat. The lavender notes are soothing and therapeutic, while the subtle hint of sea salt adds a refreshing twist. The balance between the two is impeccable, creating an ambiance that is both relaxing and invigorating. Burn time: One of the standout features of this candle is its impressive burn time. It burns evenly, without tunneling, and lasts for hours on end. Whether I'm unwinding after a long day or setting the mood for a cozy evening in, I can rely on this candle to provide long-lasting enjoyment. Packaging: The packaging of the Chesapeake Bay Candle PT31905 is simple yet elegant. The glass jar exudes a sense of sophistication, while the minimalist label complements the overall aesthetic. It's the kind of candle you'd proudly display in any room of your home or office. Wax quality: I appreciate that this candle is crafted from high-quality, eco-friendly soy wax. Not only does soy wax burn cleaner and longer than traditional paraffin wax, but it's also a sustainable choice. Knowing that I'm supporting environmentally conscious practices only enhances my enjoyment of this candle. Price: While the Chesapeake Bay Candle PT31905 is priced slightly higher than some alternatives, its exceptional quality justifies the cost. In my opinion, the superior fragrance, burn time, and eco-friendly ingredients make it a worthwhile investment."

Aside from being pretty & oddly enough matching my deck decor, the scents (eucalyptus and lemongrass) keep the bugs away while we’re enjoying time outside! It’s relaxing, easy to light and seems as if it’s going to last the rest of the summer. Definitely recommend!"

I was really excited for this candle. I've been experimenting with candles lately and wanted this to be the candle I burn while working from home. It arrived last night and as soon as I opened it this morning and gave it a whiff, my first thought was, this smells like bug spray! I briefly thought about returning it, but I was so looking forward to a candle touted as awaken + invigorate that I still wanted to at least give it a chance. So I went ahead and lit it and have had it going for a while... still not great! The candle looks really nice and the smell isn't super offensive (kinda subtle actually), but it's just not pleasant for anyone who knows what roach spray smells like... I guess we can blame Raid for that. And like another reviewer said (wish I read that before I bought this), I smell no eucalyptus at all. It's so disappointing, but I guess that's the risk you take buying candles online rather than getting them in person so you can smell them first. I'm still going to give it a chance for the day and see if it grows on me or something, but I have low expectations at this point. And I surely won't be lighting it if I know anyone's coming over anytime soon for fear that they think I have a roach problem."

After several hours of burning, the candle began releasing a very nice fragrance which filled my small bathroom in the evenings. I like to light candles in the evening in my bathroom, keeping the door partially closed so when I get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, it has a wonderful scent. I blow the candle out before going to bed; the scent lingers nicely. I keep a small flameless candle lit, getting up in the middle of the night so no harsh lights to fully wake me. I just bought my second candle; I like it so much. Really challenging finding strong fragrance candles, here's the best I've bought in the last few months: 1. Lavender scented candle gift for women, 7oz candle 50 hours long burning. Beautiful container, lovely fragrance that envelops a small room: $13.00 2. Home lights - lavender & bergamot – I’ve purchased this candle 5 times. $15.99. 3. Thymes Frasier candles – great strong scent but not cheap. 4. Nevaeheart scented candle for home, pine & eucalyptus, 15.17 oz candle gift set for women, natural soy wax, large candle, fantastic fragrance, purchased 4 of them, hard to find though. 5. Diteryy rose candle, highly fragrant and only $11.99 as of April 2024."

I will likely keep ordering this specific scent because it makes me happy :)"

The glass is nicely frosted, so it gives a nice soft glow. I'm very pleased, and I'm almost ready for a new one!

I really like the smell of this candle - it's clean and fresh. It smells a bit like men's cologne or aftershave. But it tunnels so badly no matter how long or short the wick is. I had to scoop out like 20% of the candle to get it to even keep burning, and put foil over it, leaning in to heat the wax evenly enough to melt to one level. I lit it again - and it just started tunneling again immediately - so I can only burn it with aluminum foil wrapped around it and leaning over the top. Not exactly the best decor look. Thankfully, I have multiple wax melters, so the extra wax didn't go to waste - but I would never buy this brand again."

I was so looking forward to this candle because it has such great reviews. I’m just looking for something that I didn’t have to keep lit and let the scent roam. Unfortunately, this was not that candle. After lighting it once, it burned out in five minutes. I lit it again hoping it was just a snag, and after another five minutes, it burned out. I tried again, and the third time it lasted about 10 minutes. It kept making a deeper and deeper hole for itself as the wax filled up, and now I can’t even light it anymore because the wick is completely under wax. I had this candle less than an hour. As for the scent, I barely smell anything. I will be exchanging this immediately. I believe a lot of these reviews are fake, but I will give the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt and say this was a flop candle. I’ll let them send me one more, and I’ll keep you posted with my honest review. Okay, here’s my second review. It’s been two days since I got the new candle, and it burns beautifully. There’s no hole, it doesn’t burn out every five minutes. In fact, I lit it once, and it stayed lit, and the smell is perfect. So, beware if you get a busted candle. It could happen. Just return it for a brand new one. You won’t be disappointed the second time, hopefully, because I’m very happy with this product now."

The candles last for a very long time for me but I also do not burn candles every day. (I would say maybe 2/3 times a week for about 3-4 hours of use) I also added a second picture with a remote and an Xbox controller for size comparison. (This review is for the smaller candle with the deeper teal color.)"

I would have been very pleased with the balance + harmony candle itself. The scent is uniquely pleasant and relaxing, and the wood-topped, colored glass container is lovely. It came packaged securely in a nice cardboard box; however, the candle wax had melted in transit and the scented oil used leaked through the packaging. Sadly, this made the candle ungiftable, which was my original intention. I highly recommend the candle, just don't order it during the summer months if you live in a warmer climate."

I am a migraine queen. Certain scents cause instant migraines due to whatever is used to scent the candle. This one does not contain problem oils. (I haven't nailed down said problems, and I never know from just smelling the unlit candle. It is after the candle is lit that the migraine kicks in.) No migraine from this one. The scent is delicate but long-lasting. It scents the room nicely, and the scent lingers even after the candle is extinguished. The candle is a good one that doesn't melt away to nothing in an hour, leaving the buyer wondering why they paid so much for a cheap thrill. I gifted one to a co-worker who gives it high marks, good praise indeed. This person is hard to please and sets a very high bar.

I chose this company because its name: Chesapeake Bay Candles. The name brought back some good childhood memories of growing up as a U.S. Army brat in Maryland and around the Chesapeake Bay. Patronizing the shops and homemade goods. Simpler, somewhat soothing, relaxing times. Anyways, this candle has a slow burn & a light to medium 'throw'. But I must admit, I didn't get a hint of jasmine or cashmere. Unless cashmere and jasmine are supposed to smell like lightly scented hand soap, bleach and fresh fern & a hint of honeysuckle/ moss-covered waterfalls in a national park. Which it isn't supposed to. And mind you, I was burning this in my living room. Not the bathroom & no bleach anywhere. In fact, I'm fresh out. Go figure. It's all in the nose of the beholder. Lol who knows? You might actually smell the jasmine or cashmere... or something else completely different. Hopefully pleasing to your olfactory senses. But it's a win all the same and functions perfectly in the loo. The fragrance is perfect without being too heady. No heinous powdery or perfumed or even 'fabric softener type' scents that are popular; the latter I sometimes grab like every other person out there. Also, no high flame or flare-up. Nevertheless, you should still keep a close eye on any candle. Because it has such a light but clean & fresh smell, this candle functions best in a small space: restroom, den, an office space, a guest room. You get the idea. It is a tranquil aroma that's a gentler way to start your day with your morning shower. I look forward to testing out Chesapeake Bay Candle's other goods."

I have bought several Chesapeake Bay Candle scented candles, this time in a variety of scents. This time I got Stillness + Purity (Rose Water), Large and was really not impressed by its scent. It was an off smell of rose, not relaxing at all. I like all the other scents by this same brand I have tried. This one just smelled like fake sort of rose with a huge linger of powder or something, which did not blend well at all with rose. It smells, not to be rude, but like a cheap, overpowering, powdery perfume someone really old would wear. I would return it, but I tried it and lit it, and now it's junk - I cannot stand it another moment. I do recommend other scents, including Thyme Lavender, Lily Pear, or even tobacco-scented versions of Chesapeake Bay soy candles (they are long-lasting, burn clean, and look quite good overall). They all didn't disappoint, but this one was a huge miss for me. I would skip the rose."

I was looking for a fresh, light, summery scented candle and bought this on a whim... I particularly like citrus scents... I should have trusted the predominant 'imitation' strawberry scent I noticed before I opened the package as there's none to barely any discernible tangerine aroma, especially when it's lit... This makes it far too sweet and even cheap-smelling to me... If you do like that kind of sweet berry kid's cereal scent, know that it's a powerful candle as the scent definitely permeates the room... It's a very pretty color and package and the 3-wick candle also looks very pretty when burning."

The labels can be removed easily to give a clean look. This jar is black glass, while the first smaller one was clear. The clear looks messier once the candle starts to melt down.

Safe ingredients ❤️ This is my 3rd purchase of these candles! I absolutely love them! I used to buy the Bath & Body Works candles because they truly smell incredible, but they were not only overpriced but also super toxic for our health, hormones, and well-being in general. So, I did my research about most of the candles out there, and even the ones that seem to be less harmful still are. I came across these candles from a TikTok girl that recommended them, and when they arrived, they already smelled from the package! I only have to light them up for a few minutes, and our whole living room smells amazing! I also put another one in our room, and it smells amazing in just 1 minute! Definitely purchasing more!!!!"

I went to a trendy new restaurant and one of these candles was burning in the bathroom. I loved the smell so I looked them up and purchased their best seller. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the scent the restaurant was using, but I loved it. It's a white floral with the weight of oud and a touch of high-class powder. I can see how others think it's a bit dated, but I think it smells wonderful. So strong and lasts and lasts. I've burned through most of the jasmine oud one and then decided to try a different smell for the second candle. My best friend had some sandalwood rose lotion when we were younger, and I was expecting something similar. It's vaguely like that lotion, but this is a more realistic rose. My boyfriend wasn't a fan because he doesn't like roses. The jasmine one was stronger, but this one is a nice change of pace. The sandalwood is there and gives it a modern spin. I'll burn it when he's not at my apt. I also love that these are soy wax candles with a cotton wick. I don't feel like I'm inhaling petro products."

I bought this candle looking for a Le Labo Santal 26 dupe. Upon arrival, it was packaged really well and had the aesthetic of Le Labo products. The candle is a really good option as a gift since it basically only needs to be wrapped to be a giftable item. The candle itself, however, smells nothing like Santal. I own Santal 33 and know Santal 26 very well, and this candle has basically no resemblance to either. Now don't get me wrong, this candle smells pretty good and is very strong, which is great for me because my roommate has a very heavy ethnic smell and this covers it up very well for when guests come over. The smell of the candle does have some sandalwood scent and it is pleasing, but just isn't Santal 26 or 33. If you want the Santal 26 candle smell, I recommend you just buy the candle or its room spray equivalent which is $100 on the website for 100ml."

I am replacing my current candles with non-toxic, clean-burning soy wax, so I really wanted to like this candle. But wow... scent is way too strong! It's overpowering and headache-inducing. Maybe it's the particular scent I selected, but definitely a disappointment. Unfortunately, after three attempts, I will be discarding this candle. I prefer a subtle, less-is-more fragrance. Update 2/9/2024: I was advised by Lulu Candle Company that there are scents with a softer scent throw. I took a chance and ordered the Tobacco Spice and Vanilla - and I'm enjoying it. Less overpowering and invokes a nostalgic warm and cozy vibe."

I've been slowly trying to replace all of my big brand toxic candles around the house with better options. Did you know that candles that contain artificial colors, synthetic wicks, and paraffin wax or blended wax are actually carcinogenic? Not for me. Lulu Candles checks all the boxes for a clean candle so I don’t have to give up the cozy warmth when I have company or just simply want some relaxing ambiance all to myself. My personal favorites so far are tobacco spice and vanilla - which has a smoky richness cut with sweet notes, and sandalwood rose - the woodsy depth of sandalwood with just enough floral not to be overpowering or too powdery. I can’t wait to try out a few more; all of the sizes are simple and aesthetically pleasing with a neutral boutique apothecary vibe. And yes, they are a bit pricey compared to other 100% soy candles available, but the scent selection is much wider with Lulu Candles. I personally have not had any problems with weakness of scent or wax tunneling as other consumers mentioned. My only critique would be that I wish the 9oz came with a lid - but I’ve just been putting them back in the paper box they are shipped in when I switch them out."

As far as the scent goes, the smell reminds me of the garage in Harvard Square... I know that won't mean anything to most of you, but if you know, you know! I'd say it's kind of slightly like nag champa incense, with patchouli and cedarwood, but more sophisticated, in a luxury hotel scent kind of way?!? I have no clue how to explain scents, but it smells really good! Also, I have no clue what oud is, but I think I love it...

The media could not be loaded. I originally bought these candles because my husband loves to cook and his cooking stinks up our house. He's such a love bug, but that doesn't mean our home has to smell like garlic and feet. Bless his heart. All of the candles I've purchased from other brands last a few days and emit a faint aroma of scent, barely noticeable. So, I tried this one. Not expecting much, I was really surprised that within an hour, my whole house (1700 sq ft) smelled so nice, but not overpowered by fragrance. I was all, nice. A few hours later, at bedtime, I went to blow out the candle and noticed the wax had barely melted down, like barely at all. Normally, after several hours of burning scented candles, there would be a pool of melted wax floating in the candle. Not this candle. The wax lasts so long, there was hardly a divot in the candle, like it had just been lit. This candle is worth every single penny. You'll wind up actually saving money, not needing to buy many candles, just to make your home smell nice. New, longtime customer here!"

Seller contacted me and said it was a defective wick and is sending a replacement. This is the second candle I bought from Lulu. While the smell is great, the candle burns down the wick and leaves most of the wax behind with no means of burning the rest of the candle. I thought the first candle doing this was a fluke, but nope. Second candle did the same thing. My search for a nice-smelling, properly burning candle continues. Edited to clarify: wick burns faster than the candle, so you have to drain off the wax to get to the wick."

My first order was the famous jasmine-oud-sandalwood and the intensity of the candle was incredible. So far my fav! I mix with a pomegranate candle and it’s fire combined! High-end luxury living at its finest is what your home will smell like. Lol, it reminded me of a high-end boutique-specific candle that I love to purchase here in my town because of its scent intensity. (Not to the point of getting a migraine strong, but maybe in a small bathroom?) Both the jos & the candle from my boutique can be lit for 20 mins and leave my entire main living room (22ft ceilings) including entryway smelling amazing. I read a review saying this particular candle, sg, reminded them of diva (Tyler candles) scent. It is something we use in our home daily - tarts in our burner as well as the detergent, which I highly recommend (a little goes a long way, mix with unscented detergent). I was disappointed because I don’t smell diva, but it still is a pretty scent. I can identify rose, which isn’t overbearing. Definitely more feminine, softer, and I think I’ll be using it in my guest 1/2 bath. I just ordered p santo and I am so excited to try and review! All in all, excellent find and purchases. I will continue purchasing these and even give as gifts. I do wish they came in larger sizes… 3 wick would be fantastic. The box/packaging is great for giving as a gift, as I plan to do a gift basket on Mother’s Day."

I couldn’t even bring myself to burn it because it smells like an old church. It smells like your grandmother who sprays way too much perfume to cover up her cigarette smell. It smells like if Hobby Lobby was on fire and you’re forced to smell the scent of every cheap potpourri burning at the same time. The fact that people are actually saying this smells like a hotel lobby has to be a social experiment. I don’t know what hotels you’re staying at for that to be a legit reaction to this candle. I’m ashamed of myself mostly for believing the internet could provide a solid recommendation on a candle.

I have spent years fighting to find a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones since no phone manufacturer wants to make a decent phone with a jack anymore (which is endlessly stupid, but I digress). I have tried everything from fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality. These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may vary on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money. I was loathe to go to over-ears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (Usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near-perfect noise passthrough. The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise passthrough, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free. There are some minor flaws with them, though. First, sometimes very low bassy notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough will sound muddled. Also, the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy. Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode. My final complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear me fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes. But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them, it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got."

Their performance is amazing. I wish I didn’t have to download an app to really get full quality, but that’s one downside. The sound quality is gravitating with the surround sound, and the noise cancellation mode is great for going in crowded places, as someone who gets overwhelmed. I mowed the yard, and with the NC, my ears were much at ease from the loud noise. I love the build of the headphones, sleek but also angular and round at the right places. As a girl who loves to personalize things, I wish there was more space on the surface of the cuffs to add stickers, but that’s just a small unneeded want. The ear cups fit ears perfectly, and they do not push down on your ears or head, making wearing them for hours not leave slight pain like most headphones do. I love that pressing the power button once tells the user the battery power, and pressing it for two seconds turns it off. It’s easy to use and does not require mass amounts of brain cells waiting to be lost. I have yet to test the durability as I just got them a day ago. On the other hand, the charging is impeccable. I received them at 60% charge and have been using them for quite some time, and they are still at 56%. Along with the NC mode, the headphones also come with an ambient mode for everyday use, for people who want to hear their surroundings as a safety mechanism, which is great versatility. One con I noticed upon inspection is that they don’t fold down like most headphones. Now I know they weren’t advertised like that, but I still wish that was a quality. I bet there are much better quality and overall everything headphones out there, but for a discounted Prime Day price of $88, which is cheap for headphones (but not for my wallet), these are a steal, and I give these an 8.5/10!"

The 720N headphones are a great pick for the price! Being Sony, the performance is great. There is only one flaw, and it is the noise cancelling. The noise cancelling is great for the price, but it doesn’t cancel out everything. Most everything it cancels out though. Now for appearance. The 720N’s appearance doesn’t really have much to it. Just black, white, or blue. As for appearance, the 720N’s have a 3.5 port for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, etc., though the 3.5 port only works when the headphones are powered off. I love that with the Headphones Connect app, you can customize almost everything with the headphones (you can even connect 2 devices simultaneously). The 720N headphones have Alexa built in, which doesn’t work the best. When it works, it’s good. The headphones' ear part moves flat. I forgot to mention that the headphones also feature ambient sound mode which uses the mics on the headphones and amplifies it in your ears so it’s not as muffled. The sound quality, once again, is great!"

I've had these headphones for like half a year now, and I've had no problems so far. These headphones sound great, look great, feel great, and overall have a wonderful build quality. Connectivity is great, hardly ever cuts out. These headphones don't have a case, but if you don't mind that, they are easily portable. Clarity is great, and the UI and app are easy to understand. I think it was worth the price for sure. Some additional features such as noise cancellation and ambient aware work extremely well as well. I use ambient aware almost all the time. It sounds really good. I don't feel like I'm listening to bad mic feedback with these, the mic is great. Would recommend!"

Decent but comparing these to other headphones I've owned, both a cheaper and more expensive pair, the price does not justify the product. Pros vs cons: - Quality: This is a con for me, the cheap plastic makes it lightweight but I cannot see these being durable. The pads feel similar to the cheaper pair I've owned and possible to break down easily over time/use. - Sound: This is a pro for me, the sound is actually really great and will definitely be the highlight of the cost you spend on these. I mean this is the biggest reason we buy headphones, right? The question is if the sound is really $150 worth? I've experienced cheaper headphones with just as good of sound. - Ease of use: This is a pro for me, the connectivity seems to be seamless and Google connection is a plus. - Comfort: This is a con for me, the pads at both the ears and top make this a difficult headphone to wear for multiple hours. - Noise cancellation: This is a con for me, and while the NC does work, it seems to be directional and compared to others I own, this doesn't work nearly as effectively. - Look: This a pro for me, since these are more sleek they do give a better appeal than my bulkier headphones. Overall this is my personal experience and preference, if you decide to buy you may feel differently. In my honest opinion, the market for headphones is so vast and there are a lot better options at a more affordable cost. If cost is less of an issue, spend a bit more and go with something even better. This product should not cost more than $100."

Comfort is still a bit hit or miss. I will say the choice to put those microphones or whatever those things that stick out on the insides of the ear cups was not great. I don't always feel them pressing on my ears but the ear pads are not very thick and if you don't have them on in exactly the right way (assuming you can find a way that works for you) then the pads will flatten a bit and you'll feel them on your ears. It's not exactly painful, just unpleasant. 2. And I feel the need to come back to the ear cushions themselves. Again, they just barely fit over my ears. And I wear glasses so this is a big issue with most headphones. I can sometimes get the cushions just right so they don't smash the tips of my ears against the arms of my glasses too much but it sometimes takes a bit of extra fiddling around with them that can be annoying when I'm not in the mood for it. Again, not too much of a knock against Sony since this is a widespread issue with headphones in general. Manufacturers just seem to think if they make the cushions soft, they will be comfortable. Nope. If it smashes your ears, it will start to hurt after a while no matter how soft it is. 3. The battery life is decent but I do find myself having to charge them more often than I expected. Prior to these, I had an inexpensive pair of JLab headphones and although their sound quality and features were lacking, the battery life was outstanding and I was just used to not charging for days and days. I pretty much wear headphones all day every day and I generally find that these will be at 50% after a couple of days. Of course, that's with noise cancelling on. But also, these are noise cancelling headphones so they were designed to be used with it on for long periods. Or should have been. I don't know what the capacity of the battery is in these but the battery packs they use in wireless headphones are not expensive items anymore. You can buy a set of $30 wireless headphones now with a huge capacity battery. So, yes. These are lower-end Sony but they're still well above the price you pay for really basic wireless headphones. They shouldn't have skimped on the battery capacity. That said, though I haven't actually kept track of how many hours, it probably does meet the stated runtime. I had just hoped they were being conservative with the numbers. But also, you can't use them and charge them at the same time so if you use your headphones constantly, that can be annoying. I don't like to run lithium batteries much below 50%. I don't know that it's bad for them exactly but all of my lithium batteries have lasted me for many years using that policy so that's what I do. When I see 40-50%, I charge the battery. I know they have the quick charge feature but I like to charge and forget for many hours. It would be more useful if I could plug into a power bank for 15 minutes and still use the headphones while it's charging. But nope. You plug into a charger and the headphones turn off. Everything said, I'm reasonably happy with them but I paid the $150 asking price they were selling for when I bought them. Knowing all I know now, I would not pay that price again for these. These are $70 headphones. Tops. They're not that comfortable. The battery life is easily matched (or surpassed) by the least expensive wireless headphones on Amazon. The stock sound quality is not impressive at all. (I will say they sound pretty good if you tweak the EQ). The only things I have been really happy about is once I got them paired with my PC, they always connect right away when I turn them on. That's something that is hit or miss with most Bluetooth devices and can be incredibly annoying when you have to fight to get something connected every single time. I've also been pretty satisfied with the noise cancelling, which they're the first NC headphones I've ever owned so I have nothing to compare them to. I'm not really understanding what Sony was trying to do with these. Their top-of-the-line ANC headphones might be some of the best ANC but are they really $400 good? Well, if they're anything like these, they are good but significantly overpriced. Update - 9/25/2023 I realize my original review is a bit long and probably most people don't want to read all that so after living with these for a week or so, here are some key points that I think people will want to know. 1. Comfort is just ok for people with small or medium ears that don't stick out too far. Beyond that, the comfort might be anything from uncomfortable to painful. 2. The ANC is good enough for me. I don't fly. I don't use them on a bus or train or anything. I use them at home. They block out things like computer fans and voices in adjacent rooms. I have a fan right by my head and although I can still hear it, the ANC really tames it to a very gentle hiss. If voices or TV are in the same room with you, it will cause them to seem to recede quite a bit but you will still probably hear them (especially TV). The ANC works better on some frequencies than others. It almost eliminates some noises but (for example) the sound of water running nearby is something you will definitely hear. 3. I use these 90% with my Windows 10 PC and I have not experienced any of the disconnection issues that many have reported with them as long as I am only using them with my PC. However, when I do connect them to my Android phone, if I leave them connected for a while, things can get glitchy and if I then turn off the Bluetooth on my phone, it will sometimes make weird things happen. Like if I have the ANC turned on on the headphones, it will turn off and forget the EQ settings I have chosen. Also, sometimes when I try to disconnect them from the phone by simply turning off Bluetooth, they don't make the disconnect sound. I don't know. I'm glad I didn't buy them to use exclusively with the phone. I have a different set of headphones for that. I just wanted to include this in my review to note that I did indeed notice some issues when I left them connected to my phone for a while. I will be keeping them because PC is all I care about. End update --------------------- Original review things that mattered to me in choosing these headphones... 1. I'm not going to try and sugarcoat this too much. I don't have money to burn, but a set of headphones that check all my boxes without doing anything I hate for a price I can handle is a tall order. Good headphones have never been cheap. ANC is still a premium feature (though this is changing fast). These headphones were just barely in my price range at $150. And frankly, although I like everything about them (so far) I think $100 would have been closer to the price these should be selling for. This segment of the market is crowded and if I was willing to gamble even more than I did, I could have probably gotten something I was happy with for significantly less than that $150. I went with Sony because I'm an old guy and I know that you usually don't pay more for a Sony product for no reason. 2. Comfort. Of course, we're talking perceived comfort. Comfort involves a lot of guesswork. For these, it appears that I mostly guessed right. These just fit my ears with a little pressure here and there. My ears are not small but also not that large. If you have large ears, you should probably go somewhere where you can try the headphones on before you buy. I probably should have done this myself because comfort is always my top priority (other than price). Most likely the pads on these will not be difficult to replace should the need arise, and it usually does with headphones. Sooner or later, the pads will always wear out. 3. ANC - of course. This is my first pair of ANC headphones and it's everything I want. The transparency mode is slightly quieter than I would like but it's acceptable. I've seen some people complaining about the ANC not being effective on these. Not sure what they're talking about but maybe they're coming from much higher-end ANC. For me, the first day I had them, I had some people come to see me and they were banging on my door. I heard absolutely nothing. They were freaked out because they thought something was wrong. So....my verdict on this is if you want perfect ANC, maybe shop around. I'm not here to tell you it's the best. I don't have anything to compare it to. I can only say it leaves me wanting nothing and I'm happy with it. 4. Sound quality - out of the box, I found the factory sound to be lacking. But that usually happens with me when I have new headphones. I can't say for sure if the burn-in effect is psychological or real, but all I can say is a new pair of headphones takes some getting used to for me. At least the EQ is sufficiently adjustable in the app and I managed to get them to sound very nice. It's nice that the settings you choose in the app will be stored in the headphones so the same settings will apply on other devices. I mostly use Bluetooth headphones on my Windows 10 PC so I'm not going to be fiddling around with the app much. These can go pretty loud and have decent bass. The drivers can provide good clarity for mids and highs if you fiddle with the EQ. The stock EQ sounds muffled, but that also might be a result of them not having been burned in. Cons - it's really nitpicking for me to find many cons. These are great headphones (at least initially). 1. The buttons could be a bit more tactile. In particular, I find the play/pause button a bit difficult to find and always find myself hunting for it. It is right between the vol +/- buttons and should stick out a little more than it does to make it obvious. Also, the ANC button is nearly flush with the ear cup and still makes me hunt for it a bit more than I like. I think I'll get used to these buttons eventually but I don't love them. 2. The shortest timer for the auto-off that's available in the app is 15 minutes. I was really kind of surprised that there was no option for a shorter time. 3. The headband is adjustable by clicks. So if the size you need is between two clicks, you might have to have them slightly too tight or slightly too loose. The higher-end Sony headbands with no clicks seem like they would be better in this way. 4. Although (as I said) the comfort is pretty good, it's not great. But this is not terribly unusual for lower-end headphones. I strongly prefer over-ear (ear cups that surround the ears rather than sit on them and smash them) and I'm very picky about it. I don't like it if my ears are not completely inside the ear cups and I don't think it's asking much since my ears are not enormous. I find that these do kind of smash the tops of my ears. It's not something I notice right away but after about half an hour or so, it starts to become something I'm almost constantly aware of. It's not exactly painful but it isn't really pleasant either. To make matters worse, there is a seam in the fake leather that runs all the way around the inside where your ear is probably gonna be if your ears are just slightly larger than the ears of a child. I find that many of these types of ear pads have that seam and I don't know its purpose but I know that ones that don't have it tend to be easier on your ears even if your ears don't fit perfectly. So all I'm saying is this isn't some upstart company. This is Sony. These are low-end Sony headphones but they're still not really cheap and they're still made by an enormous company that's been around for many decades. I don't know what it is. Almost every company that makes headphones of this sort makes the ear cups too small for even slightly larger ears. I guess they think people with larger ears don't use headphones. Of course, my ears could be really large. In which case, I probably wouldn't be able to wear them even if they were a little larger. 5. Also, I have to kind of agree with all the other reviews that mentioned the little plastic part that sticks out from the area where the driver is on the inside of the ear cup. I am not sure if it actually pushes on my ears or not but it seems like it might. I kind of feel something and it does stick out far enough to where I can see how it could rub your ears. I think these pieces are the place where the microphones are mounted so if that's the case, they kind of have to be there but they probably don't have to be as poorly designed as they are. I feel like I might be able to trim some of the plastic off if I really wanted to but I'm not going to start working on a brand new set of $150 headphones. It doesn't bother me (yet) so maybe I'll change my mind later on. I think this could have been avoided if the padding were a bit thicker on the ear pads."

Update 3/13/23: I noticed another reviewer mention that the padding has given out some after a while, and I will concur that this has been my perceived experience as well. The padding flattens easily, and I wish it was a bit more robust. I wouldn't say that the speakers are poking my ear, but I do feel my ear being pressed slightly, and it does lead to minor discomfort over time. So I would say that the padding could definitely be better on these, and it should be at this price point. I would maybe deduct a half star for this if that was an option, but since it's not, I'm keeping my 5-star rating. I'm still happy with the sound, but I'll definitely be looking out for some better pads. Original review: I'm impressed with these headphones. They are really good. I will, however, call out from the beginning that you lose some functionality and build quality (potentially - more on that below) seen in more expensive headphones, and even though these are only $150, I think it's a bit pricey. But I think good headphones are just ridiculously expensive in general. With that out of the way, here are the headphones I tried in addition to the WH-CH720N: Sony XM4 & XM5, Sennheiser Momentum 4, Soundcore Q30 & Q45, and Technics EAH-A800. My main objective in getting new headphones was to get a serious sound quality upgrade from the Soundcore Life Q20’s that I've had for several years now, and I was finally ready to pay $300-$400 for it if I had to. I was looking for clear mids and highs with deep, clear, separate bass (think of the difference between a sound system with a separate subwoofer vs. a sound system without that tries to pack the bass into the main speakers). With the caveat that sound quality is subjective to the listener, here are my thoughts on each of the headphones I tried: Technics EAH-A800 - absolute garbage and a joke at their price. These didn’t even merit more than a few minutes of listening. Soundcore Q45 - disappointingly uninspiring sound compared to the much cheaper Q30. They lack bass. I spent very little time with these because I knew that I would take the Q30’s over them without question. Soundcore Q30 - these are very good for their price (compared to the other options at that price). If I hadn't been willing to spend $300+ for the best sound, I would have kept these despite the fact that they powered off in the middle of calls (a problem I believe is specific to OnePlus phones based on my research). But compared to more expensive headphones, the Q30's bass was not as well defined/separated, and it bled into all the frequencies, lending to an overall muddy sound - comparatively. But these are good, and at their price point, I doubt you can find better headphones. Momentum 4 - these headphones had, hands down, my favorite bass signature; it was fantastically clean and able to hit impressive lows I could not hear in any other cans. The overall sound was very good, although I never could get them to sound as clear as I wanted once I experienced the 720's. The M4’s have fantastic battery life. Sadly, there were quite a few issues with the M4’s. They sound awful in wired mode - like, don’t even bother, they’re that bad. Taking calls on the M4s was a very weird experience; it’s hard to explain, but voices sounded kind of echo-y, but in the sense that it was like the voice was everywhere around me to the extent that I was sure that everyone else in the room was hearing the voice just as clearly as I was. I couldn’t decide if I liked it or not - all I can say for sure is that it was a very strange experience. The M4's had software bugs that I just couldn't overlook, such as the audio being out of sync with video when using aptX (I had to use the lower SBC format to get the audio in sync, and this just didn't make any sense!). The touch controls and on-ear detection were a bit of a hit or miss. Software updates are unreasonably slow - like 20 minutes or longer. They are quiet - I found that I had to crank them up well past 50% to get enough volume, but at the end of the day, it didn’t really matter because they did get as loud as I ever needed and still had the ability to go louder. And they are on the heavier side, which meant they didn't stay in place on my head if I looked down or up. I actually ordered a second pair hoping that the software issues were a defect, but the replacement had all the same issues. But that bass was so good I was tempted, even prepared, to overlook all of those shortcomings. Until I tried the XM5's and the 720's. Sony XM4 - I'm sure these were great for their time, but their age is evident. The sound was muddy and uninspiring to me. I quickly moved on from these. Sony XM5 - these are good - very good. I would have kept the XM5's if the 720’s hadn’t been released just as I was comparing all of these headphones. The sound is very close to the 720's, but just not quite as clear, though I think the bass may go a bit lower than the 720's. It really mostly came down to price when deciding between the XM5 and 720. The XM5's are feature-rich with an excellent ambient mode (the best I’ve experienced). ANC is good, but not at the level I expected for their reputation and really not significantly better than most other headphones. Compared to the 720’s, I’d say the ANC actually blocked out less noise, but the XM5’s made almost no static sound with ANC on, and that may have played into that perception because I think the slight static noise the 720’s make might just be covering up the external noises that I’m hearing more on the XM5’s. But getting the absolute best ANC was not the most important thing for me. I liked the touch controls on the XM5’s - it's easier than feeling around for the correct button. But is it worth the price? Not for me - I'll take the trade-offs of the 720's for the savings, especially since I think the 720's sound better. But I can easily see how someone would buy the XM5’s over the 720’s if money is not an issue. Finally, Sony WH-CH720N - these really are best described as the budget version of the XM5’s. Remember how I mentioned that they sound very similar to the XM5’s? Yeah, sometimes I forgot which headphones I was wearing, they are that close (post EQ-ing them to the best sound I could get from them). The ANC and ambient modes aren’t quite as good on the 720's, they don’t have touch controls (a positive or negative depending on the person), and they don’t feel as solidly built (though I might argue that is only because of how incredibly light they are - they actually seem well-built and there are no creaks, but their lightness is easily perceived as “cheap”). The 720’s don’t come with a case and they don’t fold (but the XM5’s don’t fold, either); not a big deal to me. Not folding just means they have fewer breaking points and are less obnoxious to handle when off the noggin. These live on my desk, so a case is not important to me. For traveling, I prefer the compactness of earbuds anyway. The auto-off feature only works after they lose Bluetooth connection, which for the majority of us, only happens if we turn our phone off or walk far away from the headphones. So, not significant value there, though I do turn off my phone every night, so the headphones will at least shut off at night if I forget to do it manually, and that is good enough for me. The 720’s are strictly controlled with physical buttons that are well-placed, though I find myself expecting the ANC/ambient button to be on the back, not the front (don’t know why, because it actually makes sense the way they did it), causing me to push the wrong button more than I’d like. And I wish the volume up and down were more distinct from the play/pause button. The buttons are my only real (but minor) complaint, but I'm getting used to the buttons and will be fine in short order. The 720’s are slim compared to the XM5’s and the M4’s. And did I mention they are light? They are insanely light and extremely comfortable. Most importantly, the 720’s sound really good. While they don’t quite have the bass signature of the M4’s, they are so well-balanced and clear across all of the frequencies (without being harsh or sibilant) while still having great, clear bass that it could be argued that the 720’s sound better. I just kept finding myself going back to the 720’s over every other set of cans. These headphones won out over the rest from my limited (but targeted) comparison. There might be better sounding headphones out there, but I haven't found them."

It arrived smelling minty fresh, which kind of threw me off initially... until I realized the alternative would probably be the scent of someone else's sweat lol! So kudos for that. It arrived with no issues and has been working very well for the last month. I'm autistic and having noise cancellation technology in my headset has been life-changing for me. The way the noise-canceling in this headset works is completely tunable by the wearer. There's noise-canceling and ambient sound modes. I've included screenshots of the app you can use to fine-tune it. The voice passthrough feature in itself is pretty useful, as if it's on the noise-canceling mode, hearing speech can be really hard. It's hard to explain, but with this feature turned on, if someone talks to you, it seems to briefly switch to ambient sound mode to hear speech near you. It's super fluid and will switch back within about a second of the speech ending. The only caveat with this feature, though, is that it seems to have to be rather loud (or very close) speech in order to be picked up. So if I'm holding a baby and it coos in my ear, it'll trigger the voice passthrough. But if someone is quietly talking to me a few feet away, I'll usually have to manually switch. Not a huge deal, but probably worth making a note of. I've also had one instance of garbled audio from my headset. I had to turn them off and back on to fix it. It happened suddenly on a phone call. Other than those two things, this headset has been amazing. I also want to say that the battery life is pretty amazing, as it can be used pretty heavily for at least a couple of days without having to be charged. I'll be listening to audio for a few hours straight sometimes and it only drops the battery down about 10%. Also, the microphone quality is pretty good. Especially when compared to my older Bluetooth headphones that I used to use. People can actually understand me on the phone with these, which is really helpful if I need to talk to someone on the phone but don't want to hold my phone or can't. I'm so happy that I got these and also I'm happy at the fact that they were available refurbished so I didn't have to pay hundreds of dollars to have these headphones."

They are pretty decent headphones with good sound but my one big issue with them is you can't use them while they are charging. It will disconnect as soon as you plug it into the charger. This is a huge issue for me because I sleep with headphones since I live by a big airport & need to sleep with noise-canceling headphones. So if you're a regular headphone user who uses headphones almost 24/7, you may want to have a spare around. I'll have to use my old E7 headphones for this & rotate between the two instead of replacing my old E7 headphones with the new Sony headphones like I was hoping to be able to do. It's weird because much cheaper off-brand headphones I've tried can be used while they are charging, so not sure why this went by Sony of all companies. Sound quality seems pretty decent & noise canceling seems to work for the most part & they are pretty comfortable. The manual could have been better illustrated & thought out like they could have mentioned the fact it can't be used while charging & maybe have a diagram of how to remove the ear pads & how to clean them. It's mostly a lot of vague technical info with some basic instructions. Overall they seem decent but definitely feel like they are overpriced. They felt more like $100 or sub $100 headphones rather than over $150 headphones. This is just my first impression on them after going through many other brands & off-brand headphones over the years."
11;"Wireless Headphones";"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS1QCFHX";"Color: Black|Style: Headphone";6243;969;"Verified Purchase";2;2023-02-26;"United States";"english";3;"I was impressed…not so much anymore. Update 3/9…so first I’m going to say that I bought these with my own money before any reviews were out. Didn’t realize they were a vine product. After a few weeks of use, the padding has relaxed enough so that I can feel the drivers poking my ears. I wear my headphones around 4 hours a day on weekdays and 8-10 hours on each weekend day. As stated earlier, I have a smaller than average head, and my ears do not stick out. I can usually adjust the cups to be lower, but I don’t like them riding my jawbone. I would have overlooked that because they do sound good, however, they are now randomly disconnecting. I use them for YouTube and I’m literally 18 inches away and they disconnect. I check through the app and it shows a connection failure. If I pause a video, again, they show connected, but the sound comes out of my iPad. When I check the app, it tells me there is a connection failure and to restart. While the sound is good, I don’t think I care to restart my headphones every 10 minutes. Maybe they don’t like Apple devices? I’m not sure… I originally bought the XM5’s. I finally got them last week only to find they were quite oversized for my smaller than average head. The weight of them made matters worse as every time I looked down they flopped forward. I had to return them. I am not one of those fancy audio people but I know what I like. My previous headphones were the Solo Pro 3’s and I do enjoy them. What I don’t like is the pain my ears experience after about an hour of having them on. I wanted over-the-ear headphones and everything I read and all the videos I watched pointed me to the XM5’s which ended sadly. I searched Amazon and saw these were a new model. Looked up what little I could find online about them and the consensus was these were the cheap version of the XM5’s. Yeah, I’m sold so I got them. Build: They are cheaper feeling, not as bad as the 510’s, but nowhere near the XM5’s workmanship. But they are also not breaking the bank (as bad anyways, it still shocks me to see what headphones are going for nowadays). The sliding part is plastic reinforced by metal. I’ll be honest… I am wondering how they will hold up. Comfort: Excellent. These are super light. I don’t feel them resting on the crown of my head at all. There is no clamping on or around my ears. But they are secure on my head. The padding around the ear cups is decent and the cups are deep so most will not have their ears touching the speakers. Bells and whistles: These are old school, they have buttons…no swipe features at all. I like that because in my week of using the XM5’s I discovered quickly that volume adjustment was hit or miss with response time. It might be that my hands are always cold, but in 6 hours of wearing these I have already mastered the buttons. They are very well placed and very responsive. App: They are part of the Sony headphone app. You get an equalizer and other customizable features including the ability to connect to two devices at the same time and it works great as I use the headphones for watching music videos on YouTube and Netflix. I use my phone to adjust the equalizer for the music playing on my iPad. Another feature on the app is you can set the headphones to shut off when not in use. I was excited about the auto shutoff feature. Not so much now. It is not sensor-based nor is it based on when your device’s screen shuts down. It is based on when you turn off Bluetooth. This makes it worthless to me and maybe a lot of us who do not ever turn Bluetooth off. I think it could have been done better. Noise cancelling: I’m going to call this adequate. With my Beats Solo Pro with ANC, I can’t hear anything. Not even someone yelling. These will drown out the hum of a fan pretty well, but they let in a lot of ambient noise (like my husband coughing in the next room right now!). Even the XM5’s were not as good as the Beats. But the on-ear style of the Beats may have something to do with that. So I’ll stick to the XM5’s comparison. I also want to say that there are supposedly 3 modes…noise cancelling, ambient, and off. I have not noticed any difference between ambient and noise cancelling. There is no voice prompt to let you know which setting you are in. I will play some more to see if I’m missing a setting in the app and if something changes I’ll edit my review. Sound quality: (of course, this is subjective to each person) excellent out of the box and I could not say that about the XM5’s. My first mission was to find the equalizer when I took them out of the box and tried them. Not so with these. The sound was nice. I still tweaked it but if I wasn’t able to change it a bit, I would still be happy. Other: They do not come with a case. They do not fold. They come with an aux cord and charging cable, no charging block. Final thoughts: This is my fourth pair of headphones in a month. I was willing to drop over 300 bucks on a pair. And I didn’t like any of them. Most important to me is fit and sound. Most were severely lacking in sound quality. These are not. And they were cheaper. I am most disappointed in the build quality. I think they should’ve done better. To me $150 is a lot of money to spend on headphones that feel this plasticky. And if they crack after 6 months I’ll be upset. I’m not expecting $350 quality, but better. These are not too much better than the 510’s when they should’ve been a little less than the 910’s. They are far less quality than the 910’s. Maybe I’m asking too much after coming from the Solo 3 Pros and XM5’s which both have a superb build. But…they make up for it in having great sound that you can totally adjust to your liking. They are comparable to the XM5’s in sound. And far superior I feel to the 910’s which just sound overly undefined bass. And the comfort!! It’s spot on. These are the best out there in terms of sound and app capabilities."

Pairing, connecting, and reconnecting is easy. First, the sound is great. Also, I like that I am able to have it set up to connect to my phone, Amazon Firestick, and my laptop. It usually reconnects on its own to what I was using it with, but if it doesn't, it's not hard to reconnect it myself. The range is great on these too. I can walk away from watching something on TV and still be able to hear what is going on while I'm in the kitchen making supper or loading the dishwasher. I like that if I need to make a quick trip to another room and back, I don't have to untangle myself from anything or pause what I'm doing. I can keep listening. I also like the noise-canceling feature that blocks out the air conditioner. This is especially nice for watching movies; I get that movie theater feeling. Highly recommend, especially for the price."

The noise canceling is so good it will make you wonder if you're floating around. I'm done a 10-hour shift, and the battery is at 70% from 100. The app is a must if you're going to use this because of the sound options you can choose from. I listen to a lot of podcasts, but I want to hear my music sometimes, and the sound settings help you feel more immersed. They don't fold like the other headphones, but I don't personally believe folding and a case costs $300 more."

One guy is a real crooner and whooper, and at most it sounds like he's a few houses down. Even when they play loud music, it's muffled if it comes through the noise cancellation barrier. The NC even blocks out any machine drone nearby; I can't hear my fans, a/c, fridge, or the pool pump. It's honestly eerie but that silence is golden. I don't know if this is due to a software update or I just haven't explored the app update enough, but it seems like when you pair to two devices at once, you have to choose a device to hear using the app, you can't stream both. I prefer having physical buttons on the headphones, but the pricier versions of Sony's line use touch-sensitive contextual movements to adjust volume, connect, etc. I like that an NC and ambient mode button is on there, so I can switch on the fly if I need to. I like the fake leather plush on the main part of the band and on the ear cups, but I am not sure how long that will hold up; it seems very delicate. However, it is pleasant to touch. These stay comfortable on me for about an hour. The only reason I really take them off is that my ears get hot and sweaty. These really are lightweight (part of my reason for picking them over cheaper competitors). The only problem I had pairing was initial setup, but that was really my bad because I use a dongle to get Bluetooth on my computer and the driver wasn't properly installed. So be aware if you have a Bluetooth dongle for connectivity that it has to have the proper latest driver installed, or else it will just not pair. The reason I rate this four instead of five yo, person at Sony forced to read these for a living, please pass this along. The charging cable. Bruh. Bruh! Look, I get it, I appreciate shorter cables, I am not charging things in another room or something, and I like to save space when I travel with a bunch of cables. But this short cable doesn't work on any of my PC's USB ports, so I have to plug it into an adapter. The adapter brick is plugged into an extension cord on the floor, which means I can't put the headphones on my shelf at the same time, it doesn't reach. So I have to put the extension cord up on the shelf or put my headphones on the floor. For someone directly charging from a wall outlet, your headphones are gonna dangle half on the floor, half in the air. Even when I get the extension cord up on my shelf for charging, there is still not enough room for the headphones to lie flat if the adapter faces up. My workaround is that I rest the headphones on a holder on my desk, and I can pull that down closer to the floor when I need to charge. But I shouldn't have to live that lyfe. I should be able to just plug it into my PC and be able to put it safely on top of the PC or on a nearby surface, my choice, no major distance consideration to prohibit the safe placement. I really feel y'all should send this with one small cable and one long one because the small is useful if someone uses a laptop or has a USB hub on their desk."

These headphones saved me from going to jail for attacking my drum-playing neighbor. The noise-cancelling can't quite stand up to that much noise, but by playing white noise at a low volume under whatever you're listening to, I'm able to block out the band practice next door. The real selling point of these headphones, in my opinion, is the battery life. I can turn these on in the morning fully charged, use them all day, fall asleep in them, and they still have charge the next morning. When I get the low battery warning, I know I still have about 3 hours left, absolutely bonkers."

The part that goes across the top of your head is padded on the underside. It fits well against my head. I charged them the first day I got them, and it is now day 6 and no charge needed yet.

The ear cushions, however, don't have much padding and could be better. I do love that they can lay flat though but not being able to fold the headphone in half is a serious downside for portability. The Studio 3s have a slightly better and more durable feeling construction and have better padding but are significantly heavier. Another thing too is the rubber headband cushion, I personally hate this as it snags my hair and makes it uncomfortable. The Studios can fold in half and also come with a semi-hardshell carrying case which is a huge bonus for traveling and portability. Sound quality: this one is hard to compare as well I also am not an audiophile so this is from the perspective of someone who really just uses headphones for watching videos and music at the gym. They both sound okay, not great. Each one has a different sound profile to me. The 720N is more clear vs the Studios having a more bass-heavy punchy sound. ANC: the ANC works good on both. The Beats have the standard like white noise style ANC which I did not really notice on the 720N. I will say the 720N has better ANC in loud environments. With the Beats, I still feel the need to crank up the volume to drown out the outside noise with ANC on. However, with the 720N it was incredible I could barely have the volume up but ANC cancels out the majority of the outside noise (gym music and noise). Transparency mode: neither of these works great. It does the job but if you need to have a conversation or actually hear anything the headphones will have to come off. Functionality: the buttons on the 720N are a bit hard to get used to but not a huge deal. I hate that there are only 2 modes vs the 3 on the Studios but it's not a huge deal. Again not being able to fold takes a toll on functionality and portability. I do love how lightweight these are though, you can barely feel them on your head, and are extremely comfortable. The ear cushions aren't great, you do get some sound leaking in when turning your head due to the ear cushions not creating a great seal. The Bluetooth connection works great with my iPhone and there is also an app to customize and add more controls but I haven't experimented with it much yet. The Studio 3s have a weird very plastic feeling button as the controls for sound which definitely could have been improved for a more premium feel. They fold up, they have a case, they seem durable, so not much to complain about here. I just hate the rubber headband cushion but that's me personally. They have the Apple chip for connection so no complaints there as I have an iPhone. Conclusion: both of these are great headphones at a similar price point. I'd say if you are between the two the deciding factor would be sound, weight, function, and use. If you are looking for decent lightweight headphones to have with good ANC and sound quality get the 720N. If you are looking for portable, bass-heavy and punchy sound get the Studios. Personally, I am still on the fence but I am leaning towards the Studio 3s because of the portability. I know the Sony WH-XM4 is probably the sweet spot of everything I'm looking for but it is unfortunately out of my price range."

I know I'm listening to MP3s which dull sound, and that's the reason why I need headphones that can keep as much quality as possible. These headsets do accomplish that but I was not immediately blown away by the sound as much as I was later blown away or more so extremely satisfied. The sound out of the box presented a solid sound but the volume was too low no matter how much I turned the volume up. This was the problem if I used the analog cord or Bluetooth. I then went to the app to do the equalizer thing and that drastically improved the quality of sound but not the volume (I'll get to the noise cancellation later). I'm not going deaf and I don't want to damage my ears, but the sound was unexpectedly and unsatisfyingly low for a $129 headset. I was afraid I'd bought a well-advertised product that was a gimmick. So I went to do my internet research and I found apps that also improved or boosted the sound even more. I got what I wanted!! The headsets can increase volume a lot more than what Sony offers, but you have to search to find an app that will do it because the Sony app didn't succeed in making it loud enough for me at the gym. It did cancel the outside noise but the volume just didn't do it for me. I can say that now that I found an app to increase the volume I can notice a small bit of sound distortion at the upper volume range, but it's worth it. It didn't compromise the integrity of the music. And no, I don't work for any apps and I'm not trying to sell you one, just saying that's what I had to do to reach a better volume. 2nd**Noise cancellation. I never owned noise cancellation headphones before, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I can absolutely say the noise cancellation works and does a great job of canceling all the noises I don't want to hear. 3rd**Are they worth it? Yes, especially now that the price came down from $120 to $90, but I was a little upset because the price changed like literally one day after I bought them higher and I live outside the US now, so returning them to get that $30 back isn't really an option. 4th I wish the equalizer options that I set using Sony's app would work when I choose to use the analog cord. Sidenote: If you are in your house or grocery store or more private places then the volume Sony gives you is perfect, but when you are in high-energy places like the airport, gym, busy streets and you sometimes want the option to have your music louder then that is when these headsets failed and I had to download an app on my phone to boost the volume."

The noise cancellation can either be quiet or with ambient sound. Both work perfectly. I'd easily recommend a pair for anyone looking for an easy, light pair of headphones."

I just opened my new 720s about 30 minutes ago and they are definitely better! Straight out of the box, they sound really good. But then you can download the app with an EQ and wow, amazing sound! I'm not an audiophile, I just like loud music with a lot of bass, but I can tell you that the neutral sound profile is great and does not mean no bass. The sound is crisper and sounds more like what I assume the artist wants you to hear. And after downloading the app, you can add even more bass if you want. They are a little smaller and lighter than the 710s, but that just makes them feel more comfortable. The app has a lot of extra garbage, but I finally got through all that and just use the EQ. This is compared to the 2 1/2-year-old 710s that broke on me, physically but not audio, two days ago. (Thank you, Amazon Prime!! LOL)"

This is the first headset I've owned where I've actually noticed the noise cancellation feature. Other headsets have this weird pitchy noise that comes as a side effect of their implementation, but this headset is the first where I can actually say I hear (or don't hear) the difference. Absolutely game-changing. The other remarkable thing about this headset is how light it is. I've owned other headsets in the past, and this very well challenges some lighter on-ear headsets I have. It is also surprising how well of a fit this is when being worn. One would think it's very difficult to develop a design that would fit as well as this does, but as soon as I put it on, I could hear the same kind of ambiance as if I had put earplugs in. Truly a feat not many competitors can claim and prove. The next thing I really like is the battery life. I don't get much time with it during the week, but I almost always use it during the weekend. The battery lasts for a good amount of time as expected, and while this is not unique to this headset, it does deliver on that. Where I think this headset shines is in how fast it charges. It only takes about a little over an hour to fully charge this headset, and I have headsets with the same battery life. Very impressive. A perhaps unimportant detail that is subjective to most can be the sounds and voice notifications that are built into the headset. Unlike others I have owned, this headset has very pleasing notification sounds and audible/understandable voice notifications. The only thing I can say I don't considerably enjoy is the depressingly short USB cable that it comes with to charge the device. I've seen this in other Sony products, so I won't say I'm surprised, but I can't help but wonder how this was meant to be charged by people? I would rather have a 2-3 foot cable that I can at least connect up to a wall socket or something other than, let's say, a laptop directly adjacent to it. Other than that, this product is pretty phenomenal, and I look forward to keeping this product as my primary headset."

These headphones offer an exceptional listening experience combined with superb comfort. Sound quality: The sound quality is outstanding. The bass is punchy without overpowering the mids and highs, resulting in a well-balanced audio profile. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or playing games, the audio reproduction is crisp and clear. The noise isolation is also commendable, as it effectively blocks out external noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience. Comfort: One of the standout features of these headphones is their comfort. The over-ear design and plush ear cushions provide a snug fit without feeling too tight. I've worn these headphones for extended periods without experiencing any discomfort or fatigue, which is crucial for long listening sessions. Build quality: The build quality is top-notch. The headphones feel durable and well-constructed, with sturdy materials that can withstand everyday use. The adjustable headband ensures a perfect fit for any head size, and the ear cups swivel for added convenience. Additionally, the included carrying case offers protection during travel, making these headphones ideal for on-the-go use. Wireless performance: I opted for the wireless version of these headphones, and I'm pleased with their performance. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, with a strong and stable connection. The battery life is impressive, providing hours of uninterrupted playback on a single charge. The built-in controls on the ear cups make it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, and answer calls without reaching for my device. Overall, I highly recommend the Sony WH-CH720N noise-canceling wireless headphones. With their exceptional sound quality, comfortable fit, and reliable wireless performance, they're a fantastic choice for any audiophile or casual listener."

The media could not be loaded. Got them for a good deal on Black Friday. I use these daily. They are very light and that's a good thing. The battery does last 20+ hours at a low to mid level, which is perfect for me. The sound is not bad but not great. Fast, easy pairing. The noise canceling is not bad, to be honest. The transparent mode is amplified by a mic. Sony offers an app to control the equalizer. Top band cushion is actually comfy for me. The bad: I don't like the on/off button on the left side. The volume buttons on the right side are not located well, in my opinion. The cushions are not very comfy as they are kind of thin, but seem like good quality material and the lightweight helps oversee the comfort of the cushion, not comfy but so light that you can't tell you have them on so they are comfy??? Lol. Pretty smart compensation from Sony, in my opinion, so lightweight that you don't need big comfy cushions. They also don't bend in, so harder to carry. Dropped them a few times and they seem to still work fine. If you can get them on a deal, they're not bad. Get the blue or white ones if you can, the black ones are plain and boring. Bass is meh, but enough for movies and calm gaming."

These are good if you don't want to drop a lot of money on Bose, but when these eventually break, I will get Bose instead for sure. Also, if you have large stretched lobes and wear jewelry, they are not long enough to cover.

I had a pair of cheap noise-canceling headphones that were about $12. Since I was using them a lot, I thought I might upgrade to a brand name for even better quality. The overall music experience feels about the same, but there are two problems ruining my experience with these headphones. Since I wear glasses, I'm essentially being pinched on both sides of my head at all times while wearing the headphones, which feels like you have a headache that will never end. No matter how much adjusting I do with the tension of the headphones or moving my glasses around, it won't fix. Also, I have a shaved head, so the bar across the top is either loose and feels like they might fall off, or they are digging into the top of my head, giving me a third pain point. It's fine for a couple of minutes, but if you're wearing these for, say, a 90-minute workout, your head might be in a lot of pain from multiple directions.

Broken in 1 year. I bought these with the intention of getting a set of good quality noise-canceling headphones. Out of the box, this headset sounded great and the noise cancellation was amazing! But there was a problem with the advertised dual Bluetooth feature where it would drop both connections at the same time randomly. This was fixed, but I have no idea how. My major problem with this comes a little under a year after purchase where the headphones broke while on my head. Now I am not rough with my stuff, I have my headphones on a headphone hook on the side of my desk, no kids, no animals, and I don't stretch them to the max. I was just wearing them and the joint cracked, and now there is no way to wear these headphones. Sony states that this particular instance is a result of normal wear and tear and thus not covered by the warranty, and the cost for such a fix would be well over the price of just buying a new pair. I have headphones that have been used for multiple years with no breakage anywhere, so I don't see this as being normal; it's definitely a result of Sony using cheap materials. If you've read this far, I highly suggest you find yourself another brand that will respect your money and not try to BS you with a bad warranty."

From the moment I unboxed them, I was impressed with their sleek design and the effortless setup process. Within seconds, they were seamlessly paired with my iPhone, and I was ready to enjoy my music, podcasts, and calls. The sound quality is outstanding, delivering clear, crisp audio with a balanced bass that enhances every listening experience. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tunes, taking an important call, or catching up on the latest podcast, the sound is always top-notch. The fit is incredibly comfortable, even during extended use. They stay securely in place whether I'm working out, commuting, or just relaxing at home. The battery life is impressive, providing hours of uninterrupted listening, and the charging case is a game-changer. Just a quick charge gives me hours of use, making them perfect for long days on the go. One of the standout features is the seamless integration with Siri. Voice commands work flawlessly, making it easy to control my music, make calls, and check messages without having to reach for my phone. The built-in microphones ensure my voice comes through loud and clear, even in noisy environments. Overall, the Apple AirPods (2nd generation) have exceeded my expectations in every way. They are the perfect combination of style, convenience, and superior sound quality. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds. Well done, Apple!"
12;"Wireless Headphones";"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q";"Set: Without AppleCare+";623436;1054;"Verified Purchase";2;2023-10-19;"United States";"english";5;"Very practical taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first-generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of Bluetooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does not feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here. Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economically-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using, for example, paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience. Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally, they create a snug fit using Apple's universal earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy Buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase. Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple, I believe, rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal wear & tear might diminish that over time. Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This only covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will not cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included. AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to you! There are no additional fees or deductibles involved. AppleCare tips: You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on the outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible. You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product. You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods. Using AirPods with Android: Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via Bluetooth. If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there are 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on Bluetooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find AirPods under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect. Fair warning: You will not have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform. I was able to find an app on Google Play Store for $1.99 called AirPopup. It is a paid application that unlocks access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will not have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming left & right AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more. For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods. Galaxy Buds features: Made by Samsung Audio powered by AKG Rubber earbud tips Pair with Samsung device to get the most Wireless charging case Active noise cancellation Comes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+) Includes charging cord and replacement rubber earbud tips. I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled Galaxy Wearable. This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program left & right earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs. Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."

These earbuds offer a lot of convenience and solid performance. Pros: Sound quality: The audio quality is excellent, with clear highs and balanced mids. They’re great for listening to music, podcasts, and making phone calls. Seamless connectivity: Pairing the AirPods with my iPhone and other Apple devices is incredibly smooth. The instant connection and switching between devices are standout features. Comfort and fit: They fit comfortably in my ears and stay in place during workouts. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. Battery life: The battery life is impressive. I get several hours of continuous use, and the charging case provides multiple additional charges, making them perfect for long days and travel. Siri integration: Hands-free Siri access is a handy feature, allowing me to control music, make calls, and get information without needing to touch my phone. Cons: Lack of noise cancellation: Unlike the Pro version, these AirPods don’t have active noise cancellation. While they do a decent job of passive noise isolation, it’s not enough in noisy environments. Price: They’re a bit on the expensive side, especially considering the lack of noise cancellation. There are other earbuds with similar or better features at a lower price point. Fit may vary: While they fit my ears well, I’ve heard from friends that they don’t fit everyone perfectly. It’s worth trying them on before committing to a purchase. In summary, the Apple AirPods 2nd generation offer great sound quality, convenience, and battery life, making them a solid choice for anyone in the Apple ecosystem. While they lack some advanced features like noise cancellation, they still provide a fantastic listening experience and seamless integration with Apple devices."

Other than that, they’re great. The sound quality is fantastic and they last a long time without having to charge."

To begin with, these are quite expensive headphones for most people, but if the question is: are they worth it? For me, they are worth every penny. 1. Ergonomics and design: In the design part, they fit my ear well, to the point that I can wear them for several hours and I don't notice any discomfort. Even (due to their open design) sometimes it's as if I forgot that I'm wearing them. 2. Functionality: These headphones work excellently with devices from the Apple ecosystem, great sound quality. Fortunately, I have an iPad, iPhone, and MacBook, so the change between devices is wonderfully fast. I'm talking about the fact that it's enough to pause what your iPhone plays and play your iPad so that the headphones switch to the iPad. 3. Iconicity: I understand that there are people who do not like the brand for what it is; however, it is undeniable that it becomes an icon with the products it launches. This makes the AirPods practically a fashion accessory, which I personally like. 4. Extra functionalities: It has many functions that are hidden, so I invite any owner of the device to delve a little into everything that these small headphones offer. In the same way, I want to emphasize the spatial audio, which I feel is very well achieved and makes me re-listen to my favorite songs with this addition. It is also proper to mention how excellent the head tracking works; it makes you feel that the audio is in front of you, and you can approach the instruments individually. In conclusion, I think they are excellent hearing pods even for the price, although I recommend waiting for a new version. But this one is budget-friendly and does the job asked for. So if you are a person who enjoys music, going out to the street listening to what you like, the ease provided by hands-free (the microphone sounds fantastic), and you have at least one iPhone, I highly recommend them. Although if you are not interested in the spatial audio section, I recommend that you go for the second generation, which roughly only loses the aforementioned functionality. Thank you for reading, and I hope it helps you decide whether to buy."

I also don't feel them in my ear, which is super nice. Over-the-ear headphones get too warm and uncomfortable, and in-ear earbuds block out sound and get uncomfortable over extended use, so these are perfect. These also stay connected compared to my first-gen AirPods, which would constantly drop the connection. My only gripe is when I attempt to stream Spotify on my iPhone to my home stereo, the AirPods will take over and connect if I am wearing them while using them for the computer, so I have to go back into Spotify on my phone and reconnect it to the stereo. Not the end of the world, but I wish there was a way to prevent that from happening. It would be great if you could disable auto-connect by app. That said, I love these."

But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to you! There are no additional fees or deductibles involved. AppleCare tips: You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on the outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible. You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product. You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods. Using AirPods with Android: Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via Bluetooth. If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG, for example, there are 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on Bluetooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find AirPods under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect. Fair warning: You will not have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform. I was able to find an app on Google Play Store for $1.99 called AirPopup. It is a paid application that unlocks access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will not have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming left & right AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more. For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods. Galaxy Buds features: Made by Samsung Audio powered by AKG Rubber earbud tips Pair with Samsung device to get the most Wireless charging case Active noise cancellation Comes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+) Includes charging cord and replacement rubber earbud tips. I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled Galaxy Wearable. This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program left & right earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs. Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."

I bought my 2nd gen AirPods back in 2019 and never expected for them to last this long. (In fact, I was a skeptic when Apple first announced how these things would stay in your ears.) Sound quality hasn't diminished over time. It picks up ambient sound pretty well, sometimes making it hard for the caller to hear you. Sometimes it has a muted sound and the caller will say you sound muffled. So it's not perfect as a mic device but functions well enough most of the time that it's not a problem. Audio quality to me is great. Never have an issue with sound, music, or hearing a caller. They're not really noise-canceling, so if you're looking for that, you'll be disappointed. However, I've found that if I up the volume, it will drown out loud sounds. I don't like my volume extremely loud since I like to be able to hear what's going on around me, but for trains or large trucks rumbling by, the volume is excellent and still retains good quality. (Not that distortion sound that comes with playing music too loud.) Overall, I'd recommend. I've had this for nearly 5 years (bought it for myself as a Black Friday gift!), and I don't regret it. I see no need to upgrade to a Pro. Audiophiles may want surround sound type thing, in which I'd recommend a Pro, but 2nd gen works well enough for me (until prices drop for some of the newer ones)."

People have said the call quality is excellent, and even the battery life of the buds and case (which are different) show up in iOS for a quick reading. Apparently, the case gets charged, and the buds charge from the case making it an independent power source for them. Very clever. So far, would recommend, especially if on sale."

The design is stylish and incredibly comfortable, even for long periods. The wireless connectivity is reliable, and the Lightning charging case provides multiple charges on the go. The quick charge feature is very convenient, giving hours of use from just a few minutes of charging.

I tried many cheaper versions of Bluetooth earbuds, but they are all touchy and annoyingly glitchy compared to AirPods, which are just awesome! Pairs perfectly, just as most Apple products do. You can program them to do various things when you tap them, so you don't have to do everything through the phone. The voice recognition is very handy when driving and you need Siri to do something for you. The mic is a little quiet on phone calls, so I cup my hand to my mouth to direct sound to them when needed. After a while though, my left ear is sore from the shape of the earbud. It's probably just my ear shape. Still not interested in paying more for the smaller, more cushy ones. Hundreds of dollars is ridiculous. I recommend getting the little silicone case cover, as it helps you find the item, clip it to your phone, etc. Keep them clean, don't get them wet, don't store them in pockets and lose them. They seem to survive small drops. They do have a feature that makes noise to help you find them, but only if they still have some charge in their batteries."

My only wish is that there was a way to raise and lower volume manually... perhaps this comes in other AirPod versions.

Unfortunately, I was unimpressed with the entire lack of noise cancellation, and the need to turn the volume darn near all the way up just to hear audible voices in movies.

Everyone knows that these are an old product from Apple. But I ordered other Apple or different brands of earbuds, and absolutely none of them felt comfortable in my small ear canals. Even the ones with multiple rubber things small enough to supposedly fit. All of the styles I had to return got far greater reviews for sound quality, and they all allow you to see the amount of battery charge left on the case. These earbuds have so-so sound quality, and I never use them for phone calls, so I can’t speak about that aspect. The choices of what you can tap on either the left or right side for are limited. Other earphones or buds have multiple ways you can touch your right and left sides to get sound levels, on/off, next track, answering phone, etc. The main thing these do is allow you to use Siri, as they are an Apple product, albeit several models “old.” The main drawback to these is that you cannot look at the case to see how much battery charge is left. You must open the case up when your Bluetooth area is open within your phone’s or iPad's settings in order for that to tell you the battery percentage for both the earbuds and the case which can charge them. That is kind of a pain. They do hold battery percentage fairly well, I can say."

When I want to change the song and tap them, it doesn't advance to the next song. Very annoying especially when it's a song I'm into during the workout. Aside from that, they're a good buy."

I needed a new pair of AirPods because my old ones finally bit the dust, and these were exactly what I was looking for. They arrived quickly, in pristine condition, and work beautifully. If you are looking for noise cancellation, I would recommend a newer generation of Pros because these only shut out a bit of the noise unless you are absolutely blasting your music. Because they do not have the same design as the Pros with the squishy earbud, they can sometimes get a little uncomfortable for long periods of wear. I don’t typically spend more than an hour or so with them in, so this is not an issue for me."

13;"Wireless Headphones";"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTYCRJSS";"Color: Black";27952;1153;"Verified Purchase";5;2024-07-22;"United States";"english";5;"Excellent, I'll echo what other reviews have said - the Soundcore P20i earbuds are an excellent value! I have more sets of headphones/earbuds than I care to admit, but I somehow manage to talk myself into buying another pair every so often. With these, the excuse I made for myself was that I didn't have a decent pair of Bluetooth earbuds. I had a set of cheap BT earbuds that I picked up from a local convenience store a couple of years ago, but I never really liked them that much and so rarely used them, which meant the battery was always dead whenever I did need them. By the time the battery was done charging, I didn't need to use them anymore, so they would sit on the shelf for a month until I needed them again, at which point the battery was dead again, and so on... I thought maybe if I had a decent pair that I liked better, I would actually use them more often and wouldn't run into that same cycle of frustration. I was thinking about getting a pair of premium buds that everyone seems to have these days, but was hesitant to drop ~$200 on something that could still wind up sitting in a drawer 95% of the time. I stumbled onto these and thought the $20 price tag seemed perfect, especially seeing as Soundcore is a division of/owned by Anker. I love Anker's products, so I figured these would be good quality, so I could see how they work out and decide if I wanted to spring for a more expensive upgrade later on (or if my aversion is just to wireless buds in general and save myself $180). Well, I've had these for a couple of months now and they ended up being even better than I expected. I'm sure better quality could be had, but it's hard to beat the value you get with these. They sound great, connect easily, and stay in my ears (for the most part). I don't use them every day, but that's mainly because I have a wife and young kids that are frequently trying to get my attention, and these block too much external sound to hear them well (hitting pause and asking \What did you say?\ every 10 seconds is more frustration for everybody than it's worth, haha). Just using one earbud works as a workaround, but still, I'd prefer to have music in both ears if I can. Side story - I know it's stupid, but I have a weird habit of squirreling away expensive stuff. Instead, I am naturally inclined to use a cheaper, not-so-nice variant in my regular routine, I guess in a backwards way of trying to keep my nice things nice. These earbuds are such good quality that I find myself wanting to save them and keep them hidden away. Moral of the story, the quality definitely seems like a notch above my expectations for this price point, which is a great thing! If you're looking for a decent pair of wireless earbuds that won't break the bank, these are an excellent option. I am very pleased with my purchase - it was well worth it!"

I purchased these to listen to audiobooks and podcasts, a function that to my mind seldom requires noise reduction in most circumstances in which I listen. Audio quality is very good for the price point, and even compared to buds at much higher price points. Speech is crisp and realistic, and the app allows any fine-tuning that you may require. Bluetooth connection has been rock solid with multiple devices. Beyond speech, I am impressed by the reproduction of music through such inexpensive earbuds. While not at the level of some buds that cost many times more, and not approaching top-notch wired phones, music is extremely pleasant to listen to, with no harshness that causes fatigue. I have no complaints when used for phone calls, either. Those on the other end of my calls have not found any issues with clarity, either. Again, the app allows fine-tuning. The buds are comfortable since the best fit ear tips are selected, and the many options offered for touch controls work quite well. Battery life is 8-10 hours, the sturdy case allows additional charges, including quick 10-minute charges that provide about 2 hours of play. The physical quality is excellent all around. My only criticism is that the lanyard for the case is too short for it to be used on my wrist. Curious but a very minor issue. In summary, these buds are truly a great value, and I highly recommend them."

I recently purchased these earbuds and have been using them extensively for the past month. The packaging was impressive, including a USB-C charging cable and extra earpieces for different sizes. The earbuds fit comfortably and connected seamlessly via Bluetooth. Pros: - Good sound quality: For the price, the audio performance is impressive, comparable to or slightly better than other similar earbuds. - Customizable controls: The dedicated app allows you to customize the button functions, including volume adjustment, enhancing the user experience. - Comfortable fit: The earbuds fit well and come with extra earpieces for different sizes. - Easy to use: Intuitive touch controls make it easy to play/pause music and activate the voice assistant. - Reliable battery life: The earbuds charge easily and have a decent battery life, making them suitable for daily use and travel. Cons: - Average microphone quality: The microphone quality is similar to other earbuds in this price range, adequate for calls but not exceptional. - Lack of volume control: Without the app, there's no way to adjust the volume directly from the earbuds. Overall: These earbuds have exceeded my expectations. They are easy to use, customizable, and offer good sound quality for their price.

Although, I would say for anything other than music, the audio isn't as precise as more expensive earbuds I've used. Also, the noise cancelling is really good, I'd say a little better than my AirPod Pros. The only thing I would say to keep in mind is that the build quality, as in the material of the shell and case, is not the highest of quality. It is pretty lightweight and doesn't feel as nice as more expensive earbuds. But the design/look of the product isn't bad at all. Also, I really like the pink color, it's really cute. Overall, I would recommend if you're looking for a budget-friendly earbud for listening to music."

I use earbuds and earphones for one reason only -- music. I care about sound quality, period. I don't care about noise cancellation or water resistance or phone clarity. Just sound, and comfort is a bonus. These are fabulous. I have listened to music through these that I have listened to for years and years, and these buds brought forward some facets of that music that I had never heard. There was more stuff that came forward from the shadows I never knew was there. I'm not an audiophile, so don't ask me for the proper descriptive terminology, but these have several layers of bass, vocals are balanced and clear, there is appreciable separation, and a surprisingly airy sound stage. I'm not into rap, heavy metal, or jazz. I listen mostly to oldie jams, classic orchestral, choral, gospel, and some ethnic music. I have only one complaint, and that is connectivity. You can only connect them to one device at a time, and you cannot wander too far from the device. Still worth the price though. Buy them, it is money well spent. You will not regret it."

I’ll be the first to admit I’m not an earbud person. Mostly because they all hurt my ear canals. I don’t care how small, how padded or of what material, they hurt. The only solution is a pair I have that sit just outside the ear. Of course, you give up sound quality but that’s ok. I’d rather not be totally tuned out of my environment and be able to carry on a conversation without removing them than fumble around taking them out if approached. I’m also not concerned at all with sound quality. If I can hear the sound clearly and loud enough, I’m happy. I, at this point in time, only use them when watching a movie on my phone while laying on my couch at home. So I don’t have a huge need for them. With all this being said, I am interested in expanding their use as I’ve always wondered why everyone is walking around with one earbud in constantly. What are they listening to that’s so important that they can’t be without it on all the time? Then I thought maybe they are also for phone calls though I’ve never taken a call using earbuds. I seldom answer the phone either. Big surprise, right? So I saw these and at their price point, I thought I would give them a try. While I like mine that sit outside the ear, they are very light and could fall off and I’d never know unless they were in use. They also sit at the exact location on my ear that my glasses are already utilizing so they again, aren’t as secure as they could be. These should be more stable if nothing else. They paired easily and charged with no problem. However, they still literally make my ears sore even after they are removed. I must just have extremely small canals. But they are stable and I would know if one came out which was my concern. As far as all the tuning, I just get them to a place the bass isn’t thumping or overwhelming and I’m good. But there are lots of adjustments that can be controlled via the app. I’m not crazy about controls on the buds as I never get the reaction I intended so if I do need to make an adjustment, it’s easier for me to just grab my phone and do it. The other thing I don’t understand is why advertisers say the charging case extends playtime. No, it doesn’t. If it did, to me that would mean they could remain in my ears for a longer amount of time before they run out of charge. Taking them out to put them in the case to charge is no different than using a charger other than you don’t have to be plugged in. So nothing extends battery life because once they are charged, they are charged. They can’t charge any further. It bothers the hell out of me that this is said and people must believe it, but it’s simply not true. If there’s some magic I’m missing regarding charging cases, someone please correct me. These certainly last long enough for me to watch a movie and I put them back in the magic case after use and then typically plug it all in anyway so I seldom hear the low battery warning. I keep them charged because I don’t want to want to use them and they die in the middle of my movie, you know, because that extended battery life didn’t work out for me, and I don’t want want to wait even the 10 minutes for the 2 hours of battery life they are advertised to gain in that time span of charging. When I want them, I want them now. But I would prefer a simple tone alert instead of words if the battery does go low. I haven’t started using them more than my other ones yet because honestly, I’m a little self-conscious, but when I do, I will use these because of the stability factor. I know earbuds can be super expensive and these are not, but I believe they are of better quality than their price would suggest. I can’t think of anything I would want them to do that isn’t already being done. Or honestly, what others might want out of them lol. Definitely recommend them."

I may be a bit biased since these are my very first earbuds ever and I'm 53 years old, but these are incredible. All the volume, acoustics, bass, rhythm your ears could want, plus the longevity of how far you can go. If your phone can go there, so can the earbuds, and 10 hours on a full charge is pretty awesome! It is sweat-resistant but not waterproof, so no showers or rain downpours unless ears are covered. Voice calls are crystal clear with no background noise interfering. Easy-peasy touch controls for phone and music. Plus, you can use just the one earbud if work or safety is needed/required to pay attention to your surroundings. Also, it has a voice assistant if you do that kind of thing, too complicated for this old fogey, but you do you, youngins 😊 Oh! The best part is the price!! I got mine on discount, but the original price is just $20 😱 You can't beat that! These earbuds are worthy of more, but I'm so very glad they are priced at $20.

I have another pair of soundcores which don't have this problem. These things have a lot of bass, a little too much in my opinion. The clarity of the music is obviously distorted even more as you turn up the volume, and the bass becomes uncomfortable over 60%. I usually bump the volume to 60%-65% when working out to get my last set in when I'm tired. I can't do that with these as the bass is too loud. I had to download the app to reduce the bass which was easy though. After reducing the bass, the sound distortion is much better. But the sound quality doesn't feel too crisp. I would say this step is a necessity or the sound quality is pretty bad. Fit is amazing though - small, light, and doesn't slip out easily for my ears. These are probably the best feeling earbuds I've worn so far. (8th pair of earbuds I've owned, all different kinds). The package only came with 2 sizes of silicone earpieces so not for people with extra-large ear canals. Controls - if you download the app it allows you to set the tap controls which is very convenient. Each ear has 3 touch options, tap, double tap, and hold. I don't plan to make calls with these so I can't speak for that usage. The case is nice and compact and came with a wrist strap. It's more like a finger strap, just enough to help hold on to it. It would have been nice if it was larger and adjustable to fit on the wrist."

I ordered these earbuds a couple of months ago to replace my Soundcore by Anker Life A1 true wireless earbuds because the cover over the pause button on the one of those that I used most had broken off. I have to say that the sound on the A1 model was better, probably in part because they more fully fill the ear and block out more of the ambient sound. But these are handy to pop in and take out thanks to the antenna stub that sticks out of the ear, which functions as a handle and you don't have to mess with that removable elastic piece on the top of the A1 that can come loose in the process of removing the earbud from your ear. What I find most inconvenient about this set is the lack of a pause/stop button. The manual says that you can pause the audio with a double tap at the top end of the antenna stub. I have only been able to get that to work for me on a few occasions. Most of the time, it doesn't function. Perhaps there is some very specific way of tapping it that I haven't discovered, or maybe I should be doing the second tap faster or slower. I have tried it a variety of ways, but it's very hit and miss, mostly miss. At this point, I'm tired of trying and I've pretty much given up on getting it to work, so I just pull out my phone and hit pause on the podcast or music playing screen."

These buds have 10mm drivers, same as the more expensive version. The difference is that these have 2 mics, and the other has 4 mics and advanced noise cancellation. These buds are no longer available on the original seller's website, which explains the additional 20% off coupon. So snap them up soon. The sound is fantastic. What really blew me away is the phone app available from the Play Store. The app connects with the buds for on-the-spot equalizing with 20 preset modes, no need to fumble with repeated push buttons to choose the sound you want. Also, the app allows the user to change the functions of the tap buttons. I have had these for over a week on one charge while listening for several hours a day. Between uses, the storage case provides recharging on the go to keep the buds flush with power. I am sorry that some have had issues, but that can occur with any device. I am just thrilled to be able to exercise, shop, and get on with my life while listening to my favorite music and audiobooks in high resolution while on the go. Oh, and whenever I get a phone call, the music automatically pauses during the call and then resumes after. Get them while they last."

I don't need super high quality to listen to spoken word but I have listened to music with them and can say that they are good quality for the price! Also used them for phone calls, and was told that I sounded good on the other person's end. The form factor is great and fits in your pocket perfectly. I have been using them for a couple of months with no problems until recently just the other day, they now seem to be randomly connecting to my phone when they are in their case (even with the case closed). When you put them in the case they turn off, but randomly (sometimes hours later) they will reconnect to my phone, hence subtracting a star from my rating. They do come with three sizes of earbuds to accommodate various people. I tried them all and they will still fall out when I am sweating or when talking or eating/chewing, but I feel like that is more of a me problem. Overall, I would recommend them. I have other Anker products and have had no problems with any, up until now (and the connecting to phone when in case is really more of an inconvenience than anything else)."

As far as Bluetooth connectivity, I've had no problems. I mostly use these with my phone in my pocket though, so I haven't really tested the limits of the range or anything.

I made the (incredibly stupid) decision to work remotely for three days while simultaneously chaperoning a school sports championship trip. I have a Jabra headset that I normally use, but I needed something smaller due to limited packing space. I saw the reviews, features, and price on these and decided to give them a try, and I am so glad I did. I go into detail below, but bottom line: these are great travel headphones and worth every penny, and I liked them so much I actually bought a second pair. Microphone: people on the other end said my voice sounded a little funny. However, I was making these calls from the hallway just above the arena (the quietest place I could find in the stadium), and everyone could hear and understand what I was saying despite the nonstop cheering, announcing, other people’s conversations, and general overall noise level. Speaker: just as amazingly, I could hear the people on the other end. The sound came through just about as clearly as my normal headset and I had no trouble listening to my regular meetings, even when my kids’ team was on the field and I would have preferred to be listening to that. Even more impressively, I usually only wore one at a time so I could keep an ear on the kids I was supposed to be watching, and I was still able to hear just fine most of the time. Comfort: I usually hate earbuds. I don’t know if I have weirdly shaped ears or what, but generally after about 30 minutes my ears start to hurt and I have to take them out. I kept one of these in my ear all day from roughly 8 am to 4 pm, and they didn’t bother me at all. I honestly forgot I was wearing them sometimes. These also came with 3 sizes of ear cups, which I appreciate. Other features: the case has magnets to hold the earbuds snugly, and closes with a satisfying click. The little loop was convenient for hooking to a belt loop or my bag. The battery lasts a long time, I was talking all day and barely dented the battery life. Bottom line, take it from me: these earbuds are great, and don’t try to work while you’re chaperoning a school trip."

I also have to say that I have been very happy with Anker products across the board. Everything I've bought from them has been excellent quality at a fantastic price. If you are still living in the 1980s expecting Chinese electronics to be cheap knock-offs, you've clearly never had the pleasure of an Anker product. Honestly at this point I trust them more than bigger companies (looking at you Sony), the fact that they annihilate bigger companies' prices too is just the icing on a very attractive, and delicious cake.

I recently tried out these earbuds after I accidentally put my last pair through the washing machine. These earbuds deliver outstanding sound quality and the directions were simple and easy to understand. The audio experience is great to use for listening to music. While outdoor running, there was still enough sound breakthrough that I could hear environmental factors around me for safety. However, there’s a notable caveat for those with smaller ears. The fit might be a bit cumbersome, as the earbuds tend to be on the larger side. I found that they didn’t sit as snugly in my ears as I’d hoped, which isn’t uncommon for smaller ears. When it comes to using them during workouts, they shine during indoor strength training. They stay relatively secure and provide an excellent soundtrack to your exercise routine. But for outdoor running or high-impact sports, I’d recommend looking for something more compact and stable. The larger size and fit issues might cause them to fall out or need to be readjusted frequently. Overall, I’m happy with the purchase but might look for something different for high-impact sports."

Even when just taking a walk, I briefly lose connection when slipping the phone into my pocket. It will eventually maintain the connection but only after the connection breaking up for a brief moment. Not deal-breaking at all but certainly a bit annoying. All in all, Soundcore tends to be a brand I trust. Quality and affordable audio technology when you need it. I've purchased a more expensive brand previously which died on me in a matter of months, leading me to replace it with these. Should any issues arise, I will follow up and update this review."

Anker has never let me down, and this was worth the try to get away from expensive AirPods that die every 2-3 years with a charge that doesn't last past 5 hours."

These earbuds offer amazing sound quality. As someone that would consider themselves a basshead, the bass is definitely fulfilling. The box comes with a USB-C cable and 2 other pairs of different size eartips. They also provide an app that has several EQ presets and a pretty neat finding mode that allows you to find missing earbud(s) by making a chirping sound. A few things that would make these earbuds perfect is having an even smaller size eartip pair. I notice that they can slip away in my ears. Also, maybe a noise-canceling/transparency mode would be a plus. But nonetheless, for $20, you are getting a pretty good bargain."

Fit is very good, sound quality excellent, battery runtime on a charge outstanding. My only disappointment would be the manual that came with the earbuds was next to impossible to read by this senior's eyes. I had to download the .pdf version so I could view it at a comfortable size. No one should ever have to read a product manual or quick start guide with a magnifying glass. Also, online chat on the manufacturer's website which should have been available, was not. Otherwise, these earbuds would make a great gift for yourself, loved one, or friend."

You must first download the app to get them to connect, but once you do it's absolutely seamless. They connect the moment you take them out of the small, very well-designed charging case, and great sound quality. For the very modest money, I can't imagine a better Bluetooth earbud.

They pair to my phone easily, and the battery lasts me a long time. I couldn't keep track of how to control the touch controls, and I lost the booklet, so I just control on my phone. The couple of times I tried when they were new, the controls seemed to work fine. My only complaint is that they don't stay in my ears too well. I switch sizes of the plugs, and I think they might be a tad too heavy to stay in my ear. If I'm not moving much, they stay fine. Overall, I would recommend these for the price they cost.

The P20i buds are definitely cheaper-feeling plastic, lighter weight, and the case feels cheaper. I saw that they had customizable EQ and I confused that with the HearID, which they do not have. That said, I have auditory processing disorder (APD/CAPD), so clarity is a really big deal for me, and that's something I'm definitely getting out of these earbuds right now. I wish I could raise the bass a little regardless of EQ setting, but that's not going to be a thing. It's just the choice of presets. The acoustic, surprisingly, is the most balanced. That hasn't been the case with a lot of preset EQs I've tried in the past 20 years. So far I've tried them on classical, heavy metal, power metal, classic pop rock and soft rock, 2000s alternative, modern and classic EDM, and classic Broadway. They get the job done nicely. Nothing sounds lost or muddled, at least on the acoustic setting. I just wish they had adjustable treble and bass. I mean really. This is a super basic feature to offer. You don't need the fancy HearID for basic EQ sliders. The sound is so close. A tiny tweak and it would be perfect. That said, I've bought earbuds at this price point that were destined for the trash, so these are quite nice for what they are. I don't like the touch buttons. I like tactile buttons. Especially on a thing that's in my ears and I can't actually see. But they're adjustable in the same Soundcore app I used for my Liberty 2 Pros, so that's a plus. At least I can set them to do what I want them to instead of having to learn a new system every time I buy a pair of buds. I can't speak to the noise-canceling ability until I try them at work. I work in a blue-collar environment with loud machinery (PSA: never, never, never, never use earbuds while working around heavy machinery, that's just dangerous. You have to be able to hear your coworkers and machine cues so you can react immediately when something goes wrong. Please stop. Thanks.). The persistent mechanical din cuts into break areas, which are small and also noisy with people and other sounds, and it can be hard for me to really unwind on my breaks. I have other neurodivergencies, so this is a pretty big deal. Some days I can tune it out, and some days it's a sensory nightmare I can't escape from for 12 hours. I will update when I've had the chance to test these earbuds in this setting. While writing this review, I've noticed that the P20is tend to either be too loud or too soft on certain tracks, especially rock. This isn't bothering me on Pearl Jam, but Disturbed was kind of earsplitting (I still have near-perfect hearing, somehow, so this might not bother you). I tried to make a fine adjustment on my phone, and I don't know if this is a phone thing or an earbud thing. I can usually get better volume tuning out of my computer, so it might just be my phone, but I don't recall having this issue with the Liberty 2 Pros. I've started noticing things I hadn't before on certain tracks, like background vocalizations on Golden Earring's \Twilight Zone\ or subtleties in Depeche Mode's \A Question of Lust,\ so another point for clarity. Wow. I'm reminded that some tracks are meant to be turned up and have a more muddled nature in their original recordings because they were meant to be disruptive, so I suppose it is what it is. APD is fun. The struggle is real. :/ I need a better budget, but again, for what they are, they're getting the job done nicely. I'm not sending them back. When I get better earbuds, I'll keep them as backups."

I had to deal with using them for a while due to not wanting to spend any more money on new earbuds. But when I heard about these earbuds and the affordable price of them, I thought, why not, most likely they will be better than what I have, and thankfully they are. The sound is great, the battery life is great, they are easy to use, they fit well in my ears, and I love that I have an app to change my desired sound of the buds.

They have great battery life. They're mostly pretty comfortable for long calls. For the price point, I'd give 4.5 - but they do have a few flaws. 1) They don't have a great range, so I still have to remain very close to my laptop. 2) I had to use one of the different rubber ear tips to fit my ears, but with those on, sometimes the case doesn't close all the way and I end up with uncharged earbuds sometimes. I solved it by setting a small book on top of them. 3) I haven't used them for music, only MS Teams meetings, but they can be a little crackly, so music might not be great. They serve my purpose nicely, though, so I am pretty well pleased with them."

One of my Soundcore P3s jumped down an elevator shaft, so I decided to replace it with something a little less expensive. Compared to the P3s, they have a flatter, tinnier sound, but really not bad. The battery life has been good. I don't use the noise cancellation much, but I know they help to tune out co-workers in an open office space, even without music playing. My one frustration is that the tapping controls almost never work, so I have to control everything with my phone. When I'm ready to invest in something more expensive, these will live at the office for calls and music while I'm working, and for that, they're just fine."

I really liked them so far, but have had two issues worth mentioning. The first is, for whatever reason, the right one sometimes doesn't charge no matter how long I leave it in the case, even if the case has a full charge. This is solved by charging the case and having the buds in them when I do so. Second, the touch controls are really unreliable at times. You can download the app to change the settings, and the settings are saved on the hardware so you can delete the app afterwards. But I've just had times where the touch commands just refuse to work. That said, it's still a good-priced product. Nice sound, good battery life, small enough to carry discreetly."

I couldn't believe my ears the first song I played through them. After just retiring my AirPods Pro headphones that cost me $200, I reluctantly tried these for an insane $24.00, and I was blown away at how close they sound to the $200 Apple AirPods. I played ABBA's \Take a Chance on Me,\ and the highs and lows were superb. Seriously, what's not to love? If these last one year, I'll be a happy camper. Going to buy another pair now before they raise the price to a more reasonable price (a much higher price). Unbelievable! Thank you, Anker!"

I was skeptical about its noise cancelling before purchasing, but once I started using it, I have to say it's impressive.

Also, the battery life is very impressive. Overall, a good product."

With these headphones you really do get what you pay for. The way you control the buds is by touch & not a button. I need a button. I need a button. My fingers were burned as a child & touch screens are hit & miss for me. I typically use a stylus at all times on my Samsung Note phone; it's that bad. The other Soundcore products I've bought all had buttons, so I didn't even think this model might not. So I can turn the buds on by taking them out of the case, but I can't actually do anything with them. The only way I've gotten the touch to work is to literally rub the buds up against my knuckle, which really doesn't work well at all with an earbud on the go. This probably won't be a problem for other people, but for me, it's a real issue. I was going to use these for walks, but since none of the controls work for me (again because of my skin deformity, not the buds being horrible), I decided to use these with my Nintendo Switch. Walking & taking my phone out repeatedly was going to be a hassle. But with a game system, you don't need to do anything but change volume & that control is on the device you are already using in your hand anyways, so it won't matter. As a walking in the park earbud, they stink. As loafing with my Pokémon on the couch set, they are actually really great. I've had the buds for a few weeks now & I've not yet had the buds run out of battery while playing my Switch. But I generally don't play my Switch longer than 2-3 hours at a time with the buds on. Or if I do, I pop them back in the case while I go potty, make some lunch, check on laundry, yell at the cat, etc., so I'm not really sure about battery life. If they had buttons not touch controls, they would be 5 stars for the price. And I really can't say how good the sound quality is or if they stay in while you move around because I use them on low volume while laying on the couch. But they haven't fallen out of my ears yet, so that's something."

I've been using these earbuds for about two weeks so I can't really speak about longevity, but so far these have been great. I mostly wear them to work out in the gym and they haven't disappointed. The fit is comfortable with the cushions that came on them, but there are several sizes included so you can customize them to fit better. I am by no means an audiophile, but I find that the sound is pretty good with plenty of bass. For reference, I mostly listen to classic rock, if that helps. I didn't want to spend a lot of money because I tend to lose things and feel like these are perfect for my needs and the price point."

The battery life has been terrific. I've only had to charge them once so far. To be fair, I only use them about an hour a day, so they're not getting taxed. The sound quality is good for what I use them for - my daily workouts and is getting better as they burn in. I could probably dial them in even better if I'd download the Soundcore app with the equalizer and all, but I'm kind of app-averse, so that may or may not happen. The noise cancellation, at least to me, is nothing to write home about. Again, this may be something in the app that can be enabled/tweaked, so take this comment for what it's worth.

Super sturdy, long battery life, and great sound quality! I purchased these headphones in November 2022 and am finally putting them to rest today, May 2024. I got them on sale for $25 for studying as I started my graduate program. Pros: 1. Personally, I don't like 100% noise-canceling headphones because I like to be aware of my surroundings and if people are trying to talk to me. But they cancel enough of background noise to keep my ADHD attention span in check. So if you want to completely ignore the world, these may not be for you. The sound quality is very loud and clear, and the volume doesn't have to be turned up that much, either. 2. So durable. I am surprised these lasted for as long as they did. I was waiting for them to crap out a year ago with how I was using them. I take them to the gym; sweating on the earmuff part was kind of gross, but I cleaned it with alcohol after, and it still held up great. These have also been my go-to for traveling. I've brought them on many plane rides, fallen asleep with them in weird angles, shoved them in many packed backpacks and suitcases, and have been dropped quite a bit. Still worked and sounded beautifully. 3. Battery life is nearly immortal. I forget to charge these because of how long they last. I used them all week to study, maybe 4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week, and would charge them every two weeks or so. 4. I also use these for work calls and Zoom meetings, and they have worked better than any of my expensive Galaxy Buds or whatever Anker earbuds. Cons: 1. Misshapen. I'm not even mad about this. Maybe I have a big head or maybe it was all the roughhousing it's gone through, but the band area is a little stretched but expected for normal wear and tear. 2. $50? Got too popular and expensive for poor grad students like me. TLDR: Buy these! I'm sad to see them go but I'm definitely getting another pair once the price drops. I got a pair for my mom and she loves them too!"

I wanted something to use while doing work/chores/phone calls. I’ve been using Bluetooth Skullcandy in-ear headphones, but they annoy my ears after wearing them for a long time, or daily. Also, no one can tell you have headphones in, so I wanted something obvious. People tend to leave you alone then!! :) Summary at the bottom if you don’t want to read my words! First out of the box, I charged them for 5 minutes and tried them. Initially, I was impressed, bass was good, sound was pretty clear. I listen to a lot of metal, and I’m very particular about what I am able to hear. All around, it seemed pretty good! Could be better in some areas, but again, I’m trying to keep in mind they were 30 bucks. Cons after wearing them for the rest of the day to test them out, some things came up. The louder you turn them up, the more flat or muddy/messy the sound gets. Bass, in general, seems to wash out a bit? I want to hear my drums, man! And one does not *quietly* listen to metal music. Not possible! It will not cover the noise of a weed whacker/mower, but I wasn’t fully expecting them to. I’d say it cuts half the sound out. Also, it seems to pick up sound? My in-ears have a “stay aware” option, where it plays the ambient noise while wearing. While this isn’t equipped with that, it sure seems to let certain noises through loudly. It’s odd. Like my dog barking, I can hear that almost as clear as day. Might just be me? Pros phone calls? Perfect. I can hear the other person clearly, they can hear me clearly. I have no issues with that area at all. Super comfy, no ear discomfort at all. Battery kicks ass, lightweight, buttons are nice, not too close together to fat-finger the wrong one. So I’m mixed, I know it’s a lower-end headset but was hoping to keep true sound, and bass, the louder it got. Love the phone calls and comfort, battery is great. If you’re looking for a starter, or for kids, these are great! Or just something to make calls with, this is fantastic."

There are some connection issues (but that may not happen with every pair, it may just be mine!) I bought these headphones in November 2023 and as of today, August 2024, they won’t connect to my phone anymore. The audio still works and it’s a decent audio, but it definitely is not the same as it used to be. The audio was the best for the first 4-5 months of having them. Now, they do not have as clear or loud of a sound and the bass is nowhere near as good. They still connect to my laptop, but I’ve tried everything possible and they will not connect to my phone anymore. Ever since I got them, I've had random small issues with connections, audio, and the built-in mic. I’m gonna make a list of the random things that have happened off and on ever since I've bought these headphones (just cause lists are easier!): - When in a call (specifically when watching someone screen share), the audio will randomly become extremely static and distorted and I can’t understand a single word. I have figured out no way to fix this other than waiting for it to stop. - The mic is just not good at all and never has been good. Either no one can hear me or I'm breaking up. The only way people can hear me is if I take the headphones off and speak directly into the tiny hole where the mic is. - When I’m in a call with someone and trying to watch something in the background, the audio of the video or the music is horrible. I don’t know how to describe it other than a muffled deep-fried distortion (if you know what I mean.) This is possibly normal but I’ve not experienced this with other headphones/earbuds. - The headphones occasionally will say they’re connected to my phone and/or laptop, yet they’ll actually be connected to neither. I’ll turn them on and the blue light will stay solid (indicating it’s connected) and on my laptop and phone it’ll say the headphones are connected via Bluetooth, but when I go to play something, it doesn’t play through my headphones. It will either play through my devices’ speakers or play nothing at all. To fix this I turn off my Bluetooth and turn off the headphones, then turn both back on and it will usually connect and play correctly. - Lastly, there have been a few times where I just couldn’t get my headphones to connect to anything at all. I’ve figured out that this only happens when the headphones are around 15-30% charged. On top of this, I will have to say that I feel like the battery life has diminished a lot since I first bought them. I wanna add that I've done research and tried lots of things and troubleshooted lots to figure out if this was a device issue or headphones issue, and it is indeed a headphones issue. Specifically, these connection issues have never happened with any of my other Bluetooth headphones or earbuds. I do recommend these if you only need them for music or maybe streaming shows, movies, YouTube. But these headphones are not the best option if you are looking for a good mic."

These headphones are not only comfortable to wear for extended periods, but they are also incredibly easy to use. The sound quality of the JBL Tune 510BT headphones is exceptional, delivering crisp highs, rich mids, and deep bass that truly immerses you in your music or podcasts. The wireless connectivity is seamless, allowing me to move around freely without any tangled cords getting in the way. I love how lightweight and comfortable these headphones are, making them perfect for long listening sessions or workouts. The adjustable headband and cushioned ear cups provide a snug and secure fit, ensuring that they stay in place no matter what I'm doing. Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the JBL Tune 510BT wireless headphones. JBL has once again proven why they are a trusted and reliable brand in the audio industry. If you're looking for headphones that deliver exceptional sound quality, comfort, and ease of use, look no further than the JBL Tune 510BT.

The clamping pressure on your ears is too high. So, I could not wear them for long. I fixed that with a short length of 1/8 steel rod from a home center or hardware store and two zip ties (wire ties). This flattens out the top curve of the headband, spreading the ear cups apart and that removes the pressure. When you do that, the ear cups will be riding higher on your head so you may have to compromise. Adjusting the pressure is easy. You just slide the zip ties in for tighter and out for looser. With that problem under control, I like them very much. The battery runs for a long time and recharge time is well under an hour. They automatically sleep after a while so I don't even bother shutting them off. I simply recharge them every few days."

I have a very difficult time with earbuds due to my tiny ear canals and not having them stay in. I've always used headphones more comfortably. These are very clear with the sound and the padding on the earphone part is comfortable. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the size of the ear pad; it was very small and I have tiny ears as it is. I was expecting it to be larger, so that it actually covered over the ear, but they are the only pair that I have had that if I needed to sleep with them on, I could do so comfortably."

Not the loudest but enough. Smaller-sized earmuffs made it more comfortable for a smaller person not to feel so bulky. I have the wired ones, quite very similar. No complaints. The only issue is it seems the wireless ones are a bit wider on the head, so these seem to not stay on me snug. They do slide when I lean forward. Not a lot of bass or great noise reduction, but as stated in the title, it's enough for basic living. They were actually thrown against a steel door, and they are still just going, so I guess they're pretty durable. Not a bad price, though I would like to hear a little more boom."

I have purchased multiple sets of headphones on Amazon, each from a different brand name. This set connects easiest to the Bluetooth on my laptop. As long as it's turned on, it connects & it has an excellent range. The downside - there is no hole for the traditional connector. There are times when a cord is necessary for me. For instance, my Bluetooth on desktop is faulty and using the C charger to connect to the computer doesn't work for anything but charging. The sound is good. The headset stays on when I bend over (which is not always true of other brands). The padding is comfortable. I would definitely consider JBL for future purchases. Bose does have a better sound, but the difference in quality is tiny compared to the difference in cost. And JBL really is easier to connect. Hopefully they last longer than my previous pairs."

I love using these for sleeping and long car rides. I recently had a very long road trip and they lasted most of it.

I recently had an issue with my JBL headphones, which I purchased six months ago. There was no sound from the right side on both headsets. I contacted Harman customer service through chat, and they guided me through some troubleshooting steps. When the issue couldn't be resolved, they promptly sent me a return shipping label. Within a week of sending back the defective headphones, I received my replacements. The whole process took just two weeks from start to finish. Harman's customer service was professional, efficient, and communicated well throughout. I am very pleased with the outcome and highly recommend Harman for their excellent customer support. Thank you, Harman, for your professional services and swift resolution!"

Not long after receiving and using the headphones, I do and continue to hear low buzzing sounds when I'm not playing anything on the headphones while I have it on, which was very annoying, but I got used to it. The connectivity to my laptop can be wonky sometimes, but I just gotta reset the connection when it doesn't auto-connect. It's pretty comfortable but does hurt my ears after hours of use.

It has a nice bass sound in the headphone, which is a surprise. Great for exercise. I didn't have to adjust it at all like my in-ear headphones during my workout. The headphone stays snug on my head, and it's not uncomfortable. Not noise-canceling, but it does take out a lot of the noise. You may have to keep the volume down in public so you can hear when someone is speaking. For the $29 price range, I have more than what I expected."

I work in a dental lab and I have bad noise sensitivity issues, bad enough to bring anxiety attacks. I was hesitant to buy these because of the price. I tried other earbuds but they did not cancel anything enough. My hubs demanded I buy these and so I did, and good lord, the peace these have brought me. What sound does make it through is dampened so much that it's barely there and no longer triggers me. I cannot believe that these little things can block so much. They are so comfortable that I forget I have them in, and the cool little bands they have around the bud keep them in. They ain't going nowhere! They weigh nothing. Easy to get them in and remove. I love that the volume control is a swipe on the side of the bud. Also, you can tap three times to repeat a song! I find them very good with phone calls too (Android). They are very sensitive to my touch commands. I don't have to mash the hell out of them to get them to pause, skip, or go back. Music and audiobooks sound brilliant!! I find that the sound from the buds does not have to do battle with any background noise, making for an awesome experience. Every other pair of earbuds I have had, including Sony's, has had to do battle with background noise because they could not cancel squat at my workplace. On the connection issue, I had it. The left one stopped syncing. I tried twice to fix it, and twice it stopped syncing. I was a sad panda and almost returned them until my hubs told me the left bud syncs with the right bud, so if I was taking the left one out first (I was taking them both out at the same time), it could be causing an issue. I reset the whole thing. Then I started taking the right one out first and putting it in my ear and waiting for the battery at blah blah percent prompt, then the tone that tells you that it's on. Then I take the left one out of the case and put it in, and I have never had another problem. I waited over a solid month of nearly everyday use before I posted this. Not one more problem. If you are reluctant about this issue, just remember you can always return them and get your money back if you can't fix the issue. It's freaking worth a try!!! This is an amazing life-altering product that has made an enormous difference in my anxiety level due to constant bombardment of noise. On battery life, at work, I keep the earbud case plugged in. When I go on break and lunch, I put them back in the case to charge. I have never had the battery run out on me. I am there for 9 hours. In my opinion, these are worth every damn cent. I cannot be without them now. Just remember to take the right one out first and put it in your ear and wait for the tone that tells you it's on. Only then take the left one out."

I did a decent amount of research in a short period of time, and landed on three of the highest rated. These, the Sony WF-1000XM4 and the Beats Fit Pro. I'll start by stating that I haven't felt compelled enough to actually write a review in years. I was so afraid these would disappoint me based on other reviews and Reddit threads, but after just a couple of minutes listening to music with these and the Sony earbuds - I had determined an easy winner. I didn't even bother opening the Beats Fit Pro because I knew there was no way they would be better than Bose. My previous earbuds were Bose SoundSport (a gift from someone), so maybe I just have some bias because I'm accustomed to the sound that Bose delivers. My only other prior experience with ANC wireless earbuds is Apple AirPods Pro (I think first generation?) and all I remember when I tried them is instantly thinking the music quality wasn't even close to my SoundSport. Which is a good segue into my pros and cons list. Pros: 1. sound/music quality. I'm not educated on all the components of sound/music, I don't know the exact science of what's what, I only know what sounds good to me. I know when music sounds full-bodied and that's how I'd describe these/the Bose sound. The bass especially. I love Bose bass. 1. comfort. One of my biggest gripes with the Bose SoundSport was the fit/the wingtips. I hate the wingtips, even with the smallest size they would cause soreness in my left ear in less than an hour. In contrast, I love the way these fit/feel. I have worn them for 3+ hours with zero discomfort. And that's with the size that they came with, I haven't even tried the other sizes yet to see if they can be even more comfortable. 2. noise-canceling. Again, I'm not highly educated/experienced in this area (SoundSport didn't have ANC), but I can tell these do it well. I blow-dried my hair while listening to music and I couldn't hear the blow dryer at all (I did have my music up to max/near max volume), but still. I did try to compare this feature with Sony's, and either Sony's ANC was malfunctioning (I researched and troubleshooted), or it was just really bad in comparison to Bose. 3. easy set-up/sync. Scanned a QR code, downloaded the app, and boom, I was connected. I've had zero connection issues. (I have a Galaxy S21+). 4. aesthetic. I like how they look. I didn't like the weird knob thingy on the Sony, and I don't like the very obvious Beats logo that's on the Beats Fit Pro, so I am extra grateful that I ended up liking these the most because I also like how they look the most. Cons: 1. hiss/static noise. One of the biggest complaints I saw people have with these is the faint static/hiss noise (when no music/sound is playing), particularly when in aware mode (ANC turned off). And yes, mine make the noise, and it can be heard even if music is playing at a very low volume, and yes, it's annoying, but when I considered how infrequently I would have my earbuds in but not have any music/sound playing (or have volume low enough to hear the static), I determined that's really not a deal-breaker for me, and it doesn't outweigh the pros. 2. at first they were a little difficult to remove from the case, but I have quickly gotten better at knowing where to grab/how to remove. Neutral for now/will update later: 1. call/mic quality? In my research, I also came across a lot of complaints about call quality, people say that the other person on the line can barely hear them/there's a lot of noise, etc. For me, I literally didn't even consider this a factor in my decision-making because I barely care. It's not my primary purpose or use for my wireless earbuds. However, I'll eventually test it out and will update my review later with my experience. 2. touch controls. I'm new to this, so it could just be a learning curve, but every so often I have trouble getting the touch controls to respond or do exactly what I want. I like it, I think it's neat, and I'm sure I'll get better at it, but I also expect touch controls in general to be finicky on occasion. Conclusion: while I would recommend these to anyone, I do believe the best choice for everyone is going to be different, and that it's important to know what your priorities are, what annoys you more, etc. For me personally, the primary purpose of my earbuds is for enjoying music for relatively long periods of time, oftentimes while engaging in physical activity/chores, so sound/music quality and comfort are my two greatest priorities, so for my purposes, I am absolutely thrilled with these."

Updated review: returned to Amazon. Multiple problems cropped up after several days. 1) Only the right bud would work. 2) The accompanying app refused to acknowledge the existence of my iPad - the iPad that I've used with the buds since I got them. iPad settings could see the buds, but couldn't connect to them. 3) Finally, this morning the buds could see but would not connect to my Dell Win11 laptop, with which they've worked since I bought them. I did the usual stuff: forget and repair, reset the buds, blah, blah, blah. As you'll understand if you read my original 3 1/2-star review, there is little about Bose support for this device that would tempt me to believe that contacting the company would be any use at all. When the buds work, the sound is good. But my entire user experience has suggested from the start that there is something very wrong with Bose's management of this product, from its design to its documentation and support. This is not a $200+ product - at least, not in my experience. In fairness, your experience may, of course, be different. By the way, the link to the online English user manual for this product is still in French. When I looked at it more closely, I realized that it is not even for the QC buds - it's for some amplifier or other! If I were responsible for product support at Bose, I'd be making it my business to see that Amazon reviews of my product were read and acted on by someone at the company. This relatively minor problem with the online user manual suggests that Bose doesn't read our reviews... :( Original review: These were my replacement for my Jabra Elite Pro 7 wireless buds, the left of which gave out less than a year after I bought them (just like it did for many unfortunate purchasers). Let me talk about the pros of the Bose earbuds first: 1) Excellent fit in the ears; 2) Excellent, full, warm sound (though I qualify this a little below); 3) Ability to connect to up to 8 devices. The buds remember those devices, so the moment you select the Bose earbuds in your device Bluetooth app they'll connect. Easier than either of my Jabra sets; 4) Magnetic, so won't fall out of case; 5) Can be recognized by your device as soon as you open the case - you don't need to take them out; 6) Friends say that the call quality on their end is excellent; 7) Works fine with Windows devices - something that Jabra still doesn't seem to be able to do; 8) The buds appear to remember your various settings even if you use them with a device that doesn't have the app. Very good! 9) You can use one earbud (e.g. for phone calls); 10) Noise canceling is excellent. A word here about the sound quality, which I wouldn't class as either a pro or a con. The buds seem to me to be very bass-heavy, but in saying that I'm aware that the tight fit of this sort of earbud design is so much a part of bass response that it might be my fit, though it is entirely comfortable, is too tight. I run the bass end of the equalizer at about -4 (dB? - there's no volume unit specified). OK, now having said that, the bass response seems to me to extend way down the spectrum in the orchestral music that I listen to. You can almost feel the resonance of the bows on the double-basses, or the movement of the air when the bass drum is struck. Far and away more satisfying than any other in-ear phones, wireless or wired. Now for the cons. Some of these are simply eccentric design decisions. Some of them suggest sloppiness in overall product management or integration into the overall product experience. 1) The fit in the case is peculiar. Getting them out requires an odd pinching of forefinger and thumb, and I can't take out the left bud with my right fingers - I have to use the left hand. Similarly, stowing the buds isn't intuitive at all, either in the left-right axis or top-bottom axis. I'll probably get used to it, but it's definitely a little strange. I have the glossy black ones, so there are no tell-tale shadows in the case to guide the eye; 2) There doesn't seem to be any obvious way of determining how they work when you first open the package. There's a small QR code, but that gives information about installation, not use. If you go to the Bose website (at the time of my writing this review) and download the user guide in English, it turns out to be in French! And at least one of the web links from the app is dead. 3) Controlling the buds involves touching the outside of the buds in various ways: brief touch, long touch, or a slide of the finger. This has the advantage of being solid-state, as opposed to a clickable switch that can wear out. But the buds sit far enough out from the ears that knowing exactly where that touchable area is to be found can be difficult. And that is a problem because a tentative slide (change the volume) can be interpreted as a touch (stop/start) - you need to be confident. 4) The app is poorly designed. Here's an example: You can connect the buds using your regular Bluetooth connection, although the app supposedly will do it for you. If you have connected without using the app, however, then the app doesn't know you've connected... and you won't be able to do anything else with the app until that connection takes place. And I've not found out yet how to delete the work profile I created at the app's suggestion... 5) There is a young woman in my earbuds, and when she talks to me about battery strength she sounds bored to death. I'm not surprised, since she insists on telling the name of the device I've connected to, and the default name of Windows devices is a long and incomprehensible string of gibberish... OK, here's the summary. I like the sound and the fit, and I'm glad I bought them. However, the overall attention to the user experience doesn't suggest Bose to me, or any sort of premium product for that matter. At $149 they'd be a no-brainer. At their present price, which suggests a luxury experience, I think they're too expensive."

I say thus far, because I know that technology is able to continue to become greater and greater as we advance through time, but as of 2023, these headphones are so packed with technology that they meet every need that I could want out of headphones, and additionally have some extra really cool perks. I want to talk first about the number one need that I wanted these headphones to meet. They claimed that they had 100% noise canceling and I can confirm that that is absolutely correct. Closing out the loud outside world is something that is a real true need of mine. I live in a major city, and everything is so loud that I can barely concentrate. I can't go to the grocery store, out to eat, for a walk down the road, or sometimes even sit in my own home without having some sort of overpowering noise that I don't want to hear. So here's how these headphones work noise-canceling-wise. I'll give you two scenarios. Scenario one, I have had a hard day and had to talk to people all day. I'm hungry, tired, don't want to talk to anyone or hear anyone's voices. I go to my favorite fish restaurant because I'm too tired to cook but I know that I'm going to need some peace and quiet when I get there. I place my food order, then sit down at my table in a very noisy environment with lots of people's conversations going on in the background. Relaxation is just about to begin. I take out my Bose headphones, I insert one into my ear, and then immediately I hear this sound that sounds like a lightsaber. That's the microphones in the headphones testing the ear seal to make sure sound doesn't get into the headphones. I insert the second headphone into my other ear, and hear another lightsaber-like sound. For about two more seconds, I can still hear people's voices and then all of a sudden I hear a beep and everyone's voices fade away! The noise canceling has kicked in, and it's time for me to enjoy my dinner with some relaxing peaceful music. I'm now sitting in the middle of a restaurant and I can only hear my music and no one's voices at all. Sometimes I'll turn my music off in the middle of the restaurant, and I'll watch funny Instagram videos in the headphones. Usually after a 20-minute meal and some funny videos, I'm so relaxed and happy even after a hard day's work, that I'm ready to go home and go to sleep. Scenario two. I live next to a very busy major street. I can hear lots of road noise, exhaust, loud stereos, and many other kinds of noises. I like to take walks and relax. It's not very relaxing walking when I have to hear a lot of these noises. I insert my Bose headphones, and all of the road noises fade away. All I can hear once again is my music. I have to make sure that I stay on the sidewalk when walking because these headphones cancel out noise so well that if I try to walk on the road, I'll likely get hit by a car because I will not hear the cars driving near me. So that being said, the main thing I love about these is the noise canceling. I mentioned that there were a couple of cool extra things about these that I wanted to tell you about. I do like the amount of bass that these headphones are able to produce. It's way more than I expected. Additionally, the clarity on these headphones is so good that I can barely describe it in words. There is a treble mode and a bass mode within the app so I can choose between these two modes and intensify the kind of clarity and or bass that I'd like. The charging case is a medium to small size. It fits well in my pants pocket and doesn't get in the way when I'm in the gym. That's one other thing that I wanted to make sure I told you about, is that these are the perfect headphones for the gym. I've seen several other people in the gym with them on, and now I know why. They don't move around in my ears at all! I work out very intensely, and if headphones were going to move around then they would move around on me. They stay exactly where I put them even though I'm sweating on them non-stop for over an hour each day. I love everything about these headphones. My only regret is that I let the price of these scare me away for so long, and I didn't order them soon enough."

A little background: I've been using v1 of the AirPods Pro for about 2.5 years. One of them flaked out last week so I began searching for a replacement. While I'm well within the Apple universe (MacBook Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, iPad Pro, etc.), I also use Windows quite a bit. In my search, I read dozens of reviews on earbuds, and the vast majority of them almost presumptively point Apple users to the AirPods Pro 2. I get it, in theory everything syncs up and works better. But there were things I didn't like about the AirPods Pro 1 (ANC was mediocre, and particularly bad on a plane; sound quality was meh). So I was actually eager to step outside the Apple box and try something a little more universal. I narrowed my search down to two, and ended up purchasing both the Bose QC II as well as the AirPods Pro 2, with the intent of doing my own use case testing and returning one. Upon receiving and trying both, it took me less than 30 minutes to decide which to keep: the Bose QC II. The ANC on the AirPods 2 was very, very good, but the Bose QC II just took it a couple notches better. As I travel on airplanes quite a bit, the ANC was very important to me, and like I said my experience with the original AirPods was lacking. Additionally, after playing a few of my favorite songs with each unit, the AirPods Pro 2 sounded good, but the Bose QC II again came out on top. I'm not an audiophile, but the sound was just richer, with more depth; I heard certain notes in a different way than I ever had with the AirPods. It was at this point that I decided to send the AirPods back, which I did the following day, ready to begin my new and better audio life with the Bose QC II. Everything started out in a state of bliss. Working out of a home office, I could no longer hear my wife working through her accounting problems via Zoom calls in the other room. (FWIW, I also didn't hear her when she came up behind me and asked if I wanted something for lunch). I received a call, and though I fumbled a bit with the controls the first time, the call quality was fine, and they seemed to be able to hear me OK. However, the first chink in the armor came just this evening when I tried connecting the Bose QC II to my Windows system in preparation for a call I have tomorrow. Connection via Bluetooth was simple and straightforward. I then went to a news site that I knew had videos and listened. For some reason, the sound kept clicking in and out. I thought it might be the connection with the site, so I opened Spotify and played a couple of songs. Same issue. I then went to the Bose app on my iPhone, which said it was having trouble connecting, even though it was in fact connected to the PC (albeit a little glitchy). At the end of the day, this last experience seems consistent with so many of the other reviews that I read up here (thank you), and I just don't want to be dealing with this again and again (and especially not after I'm past the return window!). I have no interest in going through a tech support call with Bose or them sending a new pair. For $300 plus tax, I shouldn't have to, and these should work more seamlessly. So I'm returning, and I'm not sure what I'm going to replace them with. A few other observations: - The controls for pausing, skipping forward, moving back, volume control, etc., work and are intuitive, however a few times I inadvertently paused music when I was just trying to adjust the earpod. This wasn't the deal killer; I figured in time I'd get used to the sensitivity and figure it out. But it was a little annoying and perhaps some sensitivity adjustments, or more of a haptic-type feel would work better. - The earbuds themselves fit great out of the box. I didn't even try the other sizes. They were very comfortable. - I liked how each time I put the earpods in it told me how much battery was left in each. - The charging case is slightly larger than the AirPods case, but still very pocketable. I could care less that it doesn't support wireless charging, just not a big deal to me. The magnet holding the earpods in also seemed a little stronger than Apple's case, which I really liked because anytime I accidentally dropped the Apple case the earpods would fall out and slide all over the place (wood floors). In summary, again I really, really wanted these to work out. I was so impressed with the ANC and sound quality, and liked how the bass and treble could be adjusted in the Bose app. It's just a shame that it had these connection glitches with my computer system. To be clear, I've read that Bose customer support is good and fair, but again if I have to call customer support to just to properly use a pair of $300 earbuds then something is wrong. Update: So before returning, I decided to try one more time with connecting to the computer. I shut down all devices (iPad, etc.) that were near the computer, to reduce any potential interference. This resolved the issue with the sound breaking out and the earbuds worked fine. I then shut down the computer and reconnected them to the iPhone. All good. However, when I rebooted the computer, I somehow lost the connection with the iPhone, and what I was listening to stopped playing. I then looked at the Bose app and it was somewhere in no man’s land, searching for a connection with the earbuds. Only a reboot of the phone got the app out of this mode, and allowed me to reconnect. So… this takes me back to my original point: these are among the most expensive earbuds on the market right now. I’m the consumer and it’s not my job, nor interest, to troubleshoot problems and jump through hoops to figure out what’s going on. That should have happened at in the Bose QC department, but from my brief experience combined with all the reviews I’ve read, it seems like something slipped past them. Thank you and God bless."

I really liked these earbuds for about 3 months, liked them modestly for 2 months, tolerated them for 2 more months, and then had to send them back when they stopped working today. When they work, which is irregularly, they are the best noise-canceling earbuds I've used bar none, and I've used pretty much everything made by Sony, Samsung, and Bowers & Wilkins. They are a bit bass-heavy, but that can be equalized out when listening to music. The major problems are three different connection issues and then eventually the death of the right earbud. First, they don't sit well in the case, which meant I had to adjust the stabilizer band and often tap the right earbud to make sure it was seated. If not, you will lose the ability to connect to anything as everything connects through the right earbud. Second, I would lose the left earbud sound at least 3x per week, mostly when going from Wi-Fi to cellular coverage. That would be fixed by putting the earbuds in the case for 10 seconds and then putting them back on. However, even that would occasionally lead to the loss of the left earbud multiple times on a 15-minute walk. If I charged them for more than 2 hours, I would also often lose the left earbud connection. About once every 1-2 weeks, I'd have to hard reset these, which meant that I would have to delete the QC earbuds II from the app and the phone and then charge the case and hold the connection button for 25 seconds while doing so. The issue here is that if you don't have a USB-C cable with you that you can use to charge the case, this won't work. You would then repair the device through the app and to the phone, and then it would work. However, the last time I did that today, it would no longer connect to anything as the right earbud won't recognize the contact in the case. Finally, the app is garbage. About 20% of the time, even when working to play music, the app didn't recognize the earbuds. I have a bunch of Bose products that have lasted forever. This one is really disappointing, which is made worse by the fact that it is really a wonderful device when it works. Update: I sent them back and received a new set of earbuds that for the past month have worked fine. For these, I've taken three different new approaches. I don't use them with any other device except my cellular phone. I found that they would often drop the connection if I had another device paired to the earbuds that was on. I don't do that any longer. I purchased a case to put the case in as I've found that dropping the case causes the earbuds to lose their ability to sit in the case, which makes these no longer functional. Finally, I'm very careful when handling these buds as they don't tolerate being dropped. With this approach, so far so good, so I'm upping my rating to three stars for now."

I actually felt sad when they broke and had huge expectations with these Bose. they're the first Bose I've ever had and I really wanted to love these. the first month-ish they were great! getting a new piece of tech years ahead of your previous, you really notice the sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life, and quick charge features. unfortunately, that was where the good news stopped. immediately, I noticed the right earbud is like the main unit. they won't operate independently while the right earbud is in the case which was a bummer not having that feature anymore, since I had this from a product years older, but not a dealbreaker for me. the biggest problem is the connection issues. the software/ Bluetooth in these suck. you could have the greatest speakers and noise cancellation features in an earbud ever and it doesn't mean a damn thing if they don't actually connect/ work properly. I've had all manner of problems on this front from the earbuds not connecting in general, to the left/right speaker individually not connecting, or going out/dropping randomly. sometimes they'll be working just fine, until you pause whatever you're listening to and then you lose the sound/ connection and have to reset the Bluetooth connection/ put them back in the case and take them out again to get the sound back. there have been times when you place them in your ear and they register they're connected via the echo sound and voice saying so, only for you to wait 10-45 seconds for the sound to actually come through the speakers. I can go on-and-on about this forever, like every other month some new problem with the connection appears. I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra so one of the newest/top-end phones at the time as I believe the 23s were just about to roll out as I got these earbuds. kept everything up to date, only device paired, have unpaired and cleared the cache then re-paired with the device, and every other trick Bose recommends on their website for troubleshooting the connection issues... it's still an ongoing issue that has been such a frustration. another issue I've found was they never stayed in your ears very well. moving your head suddenly or side-to-side can easily cause them to fall out. I switched the earpieces to the largest size that it comes with but still have problems now and again. I'm sure it's a personal thing with the earpiece sizes and you could order 3rd party earpieces that fit better to solve this issue but with the connection issues being what they are, I never bothered investing more $ in a defective product. this leads me to my last issue though, due to previous issues, I never used these earbuds for the gym/ working out/ running. so you'd think that would cut a lot of wear and tear down on the product. yet, come October here and the hinge on the top cover of the case gave out and broke off. luckily the magnets on the earbuds are strong enough to keep them in place in the case to not fall out while in your pocket. but that was it, roughly 8 months of ownership and the case already gave out which caused me to come back and write this review. when they work, they work great, but unfortunately that was short-lived in my case. if you wanna roll the dice good luck! personally, it's been such a letdown and pain that I will never buy another pair of Bose again after this."

The app doesn't work, but it doesn't really matter. First of all, I hate how no one understands rating systems. 5 stars means something is absolutely perfect and should be reserved for that. I give these 4 stars for the following negative reasons, of which I found many reviews on YouTube have commented on. After two weeks of use: 1.) The app is complete trash. Don't even try it unless significant time and updates have passed. As of July 2024, it still didn't connect, and finally, after hours of trying, the headphones sounded much worse and had many connection problems, which were solved by deleting this off my phone. 2.) The battery life is about 6 hours, which is a little short. 3.) I did one time have them spontaneously lose connection and then had to manually reset, which involves forgetting the devices on my phone, having the case plugged in, and holding the button. The good: For perspective, I never splurged nor have I had wireless earbuds so expensive before. The highest quality I used was Monk Plus because the quality was reasonably high, and I did a lot of outdoor activities. I knew high-end earphones/earbuds were good having borrowed from friends, but these are my first that I own. Before this purchase, I thought it was only for audiophiles or extravagance. However, in two weeks, I've changed my opinion. It's like rediscovering music again. I find myself with them in all day. The quality difference of favorite bands is simply amazing. I feel like a teenager again obsessed with music. Not only that, but I'm a computer programmer, and the noise-canceling, even in a quiet office, allows me to tune into my work so much more quickly.

What blows me away is the ability to make them fit in my ears. I have always had problems with earbuds fitting in my ear. Apple AirPods fall from my ears and other earbuds just don't seem to fit quite well. One little turn of my head and these other earbuds just seem to easily fall off. I also have the Beats earbuds with the ear hook but the hook kind of gets uncomfortable after a while and the sound is just not quite the same quality as you get with Bose products. Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II come with different sizes of ear tips and stability bands which have finally allowed me to find the best fit for my ears. These earbuds are very, very comfortable. The noise-canceling feature is amazing! Today, I sat in my living room with external music being played by my husband and our cleaning lady using the vacuum cleaner. I couldn't hear any of these extraneous sounds and I was able to concentrate on the online video that I was watching on my iPad. I highly recommend these earbuds, of course for the superior sound that Bose always provides and especially for those of us who find it hard to find the right fit of the different earbuds out there. Thank you, Bose!"

When I originally purchased these earbuds, I installed the stability bands that gave the best fit. The earbuds were comfortable, and the sound was great. However, they would not charge. I did some research to try and figure out the cause or whether I just got a bad set. Turns out the problem was that the stability bands, which I double and triple checked with Bose documentation to assure they were aligned correctly, prevented the earbuds from making a connection while in the case. Removing the bands, they charged just fine. Putting the bands on every time you put your earbuds on and then before putting them in their case is a non-starter. So I listen without the bands and the fit is not that great or as comfortable, but I still get the great sound."

I hate to give these earbuds only four stars because they do have incredible sound and offer amazing noise cancellation, but they do have some small shortcomings. On the positive side, they are super comfortable. Also, the sound on these earbuds is so good that I once had to pause a movie that I was watching because I thought there was someone else in the room, only to realize that I was actually hearing the background conversation from two other characters in the movie 😂. Similarly, I use them for work, and I have had coworkers tap me on the shoulder because they had been talking to me and I had not noticed at all. On the negative side, for some reason, I keep experiencing connectivity issues. To be fair, these issues are more of an annoyance than a serious problem--in my opinion--and very easily corrected. The biggest issue in this sense is that whenever I switch from one of my devices to another, the new device sometimes does not recognize the earbuds, and I have to reset them to go through the entire pairing process again. The problem only occurs about 20% of the time, but it is still quite annoying--especially when I'm about to go for a run and I have to spend several minutes fixing it. All in all, though, I would still choose these earbuds over all the other brands I've used, including both Apple's and Samsung's earbuds. Oh, and did I mention how awesome the sound is 😆..."

Using the earbuds for volume control does not seem to work for me, even though the owner's guide states it is a control option. However, cannot find any actual instructions on setting up noise control. Although the earbuds fit well, I find myself trying not to adjust them in my ears for fear of the controls taking over when I just want to push the earbud in slightly. Also, the two earbuds occasionally lose sync. Finally, I use them with both my iPhone and iPad, and I have to almost always go to the Bluetooth setup to turn one device off and the other device on manually. My older Bose earbuds that were wired never had a problem with syncing or which device I wanted (obviously)."

I do stand by that these are the best earbuds as far as hardware is concerned, but their software is bad—borderline terrible. After 11 months, they just wouldn't connect anymore, but Bose did honor their warranty and even sent me Ultras as a nice gesture. However, they had so many connectivity issues throughout my year with them, very often having to do a hard reset to clear whatever glitch was going on. They also don't have an ANC off mode??? There's no excuse for it, and it makes these earbuds totally useless in windy conditions, on a boat, car with the windows down, bike, motorcycle, etc. Bose, take 10 minutes to add an off setting to these buds in the software. There's already code for it since they turn off when you put them in the case or take them out of your ear. Let us turn them off. Worst feature, and they didn't change it for the Ultras. As of April 2023, these are by far the best earbuds on the planet. I live in my earbuds every day, almost all day. I have them in while watching videos, streams, and listening to music, so I always splurge on what the reviews say are the best. I had the Sony XM4s for 13 months, and I used them every day until their battery very quickly went from lasting 6 hours to 4 to literally 1 hour. Their warranty is 12 months, and at 12 months and 1 day, they won't honor it. I had to throw them away after 13 months. I was extremely impressed with those, so I was actually shocked when I first put these QC 2s in my ears. -The noise cancelling is revolutionary. Like, actually a game-changer. I have $1200 noise-cancelling aviation headsets, and they don't come close to these, never mind the XM4s. It makes every other noise-cancelling I've experienced seem like a gimmick toy by comparison. It's actually a strange sensation; it's so amazing. -The sound isn't even comparable to anything else. These are night and day way better than the XM4s and every other earbud I've ever heard. The bass actually sounds like a crisp, powerful subwoofer with in-depth, deep, powerful notes when listening to explosions or music. It's just a powerful and full sound without any lacking areas. -They are extremely comfortable, as were the XM4s. It's kind of a wash here because I could have both in my ears for 10 hours and be happy, and I probably readjust them just as often as any other bud at the gym. -They look cool, better than the girly XM4s that had that rose gold jewelry look that I had to sand down and paint black. These are masculine and nice right from Bose. On the bigger side, but I couldn't care less for the noise cancelling and auditory performance. -The app and controls kinda suck, not going to lie. I had some connectivity issues with the app and had to reset the buds for it to connect to them. You need the app to connect to them and change any settings. I find it annoying that you can't turn the controls off or customize any of the touch shortcuts. I had much cheaper buds with completely customizable touch controls, and the app would let you turn off all or any singular touch control you don't want for any situation. Bose, epic hardware, just hire one good software guy too. -The only actual problem and complaint I have with these is you can't turn off the noise cancelling or noise-enhancing feature entirely. If you are on a motorcycle or in heavy wind, noise-cancelling buds give loud feedback, and the XM4s allowed you to turn that off but still get audio; these are always on. Again, epic hardware, hire a software guy. Overall, nothing even comes close to these earbuds, regardless of the mediocre software attached to them that you will almost never use after initial setup. That being said, they should solve that issue because it's not very hard to do, and for $300 and the best hardware on the market, a good fully customizable software program to go with them would really seal the deal and complete the package."

I love their sound quality, noise cancelling, ear fit, and touch controls. All great. The touch controls specifically stand out against things like the Galaxy Buds+ which I owned last. Touches on the ear are registered well, as are the small gestures to change volume (swipe up and down on the ear). That being said, two things that define the true-wireless headphone experience more than anything else for me are the case and the user experience. Firstly, the case is fully plastic with a very light lid. Build quality just feels distinctly low for the price point here. It doesn't seem like it always forces the headphones down into the charging position, as sometimes they stay connected to my phone when in the case, despite full case battery. The case isn't horrible, but it stands out as disappointing against more reasonably priced earbuds from years ago (again, the first Galaxy Buds+). I won't complain about case battery life or ease of use though. It is simple to activate pairing mode with the case, and I don't run out of battery in it like I did with my old earbuds. The user experience is really the thing I have the most gripe with. By user experience, I specifically mean the seamlessness with which the headphones connect and sync with the phone when a connection is started. For the most part, it's not bad. Taking both earbuds out of the case and putting them in your ears at once works well most of the time. However, I have had consistent issues using the left earbud by itself. These issues are unique to the left (at least for my pair) with the right functioning almost as expected on its own. The times I do have connection issues with both buds, however, they are more persistent than with any other pair of headphones I have yet owned. Sometimes I put them in my ears and they connect, but I hear nothing no matter what I do. In the end, the only way I have consistently fixed this is to unpair them from my phone and restart my phone. Only then can I try to repair. I have not found another sequence that works, despite multiple resets, unpairs, trying one earbud or the other, checking my volume, etc. It's truly annoying to have to deal with this at this price. Thankfully, this could be a software issue, and thus could be patched. Fingers crossed. In the same vein, the app needs some large updates. While it mostly works well, the devil is in the details. No matter what I do, the headphones don't actually seem to remember the mode they were last in when I put them back in my ears. Ok, not horrible. Can't change the default mode of the single earbud either as far as I have found. Still not horrible but getting annoying. The worst part, however, is that the app will read that the earbuds are in a mode they are not in very often on startup. Seems like the app doesn't read the mode from headphones on start. This means, if you want to change the mode to noise cancelling for one earbud in the app you must change the mode from quiet (default on the app despite not being the default for single earbud) to aware, and back to quiet to get the noise cancelling. You can also change modes via the touch functions on the earbud, which doesn't require this annoying switch and switch back behavior. No dealbreakers here. Overall good headphones with good sound, noise cancelling, and battery. But, competing at the $250+ price point, the build quality of the case and the software polish are disappointing. Were I to go back, I'd try a different new pair of earbuds, likely from Sony as I like their over-ear and their earbud cases."

First, the positives! 1. The earbuds are smaller. 2. They're lighter. 3. The case is smaller, lighter, and easier to fit into a pocket. (Love this actually.) And that's about it. I'm going to discuss the default settings for these QCII earbuds - and there's a reason that I'll get to later in this review. The negatives: 1. They don't fit as well as their predecessors. The ear canal piece and the outer ring just don't fit the same and are not nearly as comfortable - though they are lighter - they hurt my ears within minutes (yes, I tried the different sizes). 2. They don't seal as well as the original QuietComfort earbuds. Period. 3. The sound has too much bass (bass makes everything sound more awesome, right?!) - the default sound equalization is just not as good when compared to the original Bose QC earbuds. I would need to have a separate software EQ now, which I am not going to do. 4. The default noise cancelling is not as good as the originals (IMO). There are only 2 default settings for ANC now, instead of the original version which had 3 - high, mid, low ANC. Bose thought that extra default settings for the QCII weren't necessary. This is probably a way to encourage users to sign up and create an account using a mobile device - which I can't do anyway because I have a MacBook! 5. The worst - and a word of warning for macOS users - there is no, zero, zip, zilch, nada, Apple Store app to set these up! The app is only for Google or iPhones! There is no way to get the functionality from these that you need, without an iPhone or an Android phone running the Bose app! To be fair, I can take some responsibility by not doing sufficient research about how to control the new QCII earbuds. I believe that Bose hobbled the default functions intentionally, especially when compared to the original QC earbuds, to force users and data collection through their iOS and Android app. I will probably just deal with it. I don't want to return them but they're not the old original QC earbuds, and they are just not as good, so they'll probably go to someone else. I really was looking forward to getting an updated/upgraded set of earbuds and these sure let me down. I might end up returning them now that I keep mulling on it. I'm just not happy at all with these things. I'll try and make an update in a week or so of use to see if my opinion changes, but with the hobbled functionality, I'm not going to hold my breath. Edit and update: I tried and tried to like these, but the user interface is so horrible, and the lack of functionality with Windows and macOS is a deal breaker. (Confirmed by Bose customer support) I have no way to control these, and the user interface, in regards to tapping the earpieces to perform an action, is really, really bad. The old version would accept a double tap to change the ANC settings and it worked very quickly. The new version takes probably 10 seconds to get the earbuds to a state where I could hear a conversation with a person, and that's just not acceptable. I will be returning these. 2 stars because they are much lighter, and the smaller case - but no wireless charging and the terrible user interface (touch tapping and touch holding on the earpieces) combined with no way to adjust the earbuds settings without an Android device or an iPhone is just a hard no. Can't do it."

My favorite headphones are the Sony over-ear WH-1000XM4. I tried the WH-1000XM5's and still liked the older model better. The Sony's spoiled me for their noise-cancelling ability. I fly for work almost every week. When I got this job the first thing I did was research headphones and picked up the 1000XM2's and loved them. I've been hunting for a pair of wireless noise-canceling earbuds for a few years. I tried Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus, Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, and now these Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II. I wasn't expecting much from the Samsungs and they lived up to my expectations. I returned them. The Sennheisers were the greatest sounding earbuds I have ever heard, but they were uncomfortable and the noise cancelling was poor. The Sony earbuds were also poor at noise cancelling and didn't sound that great to my ears, especially compared to the over-the-ear models I love. They were also finicky and uncomfortable. I never seriously considered the Bose options in the headphones/earbuds game. No highs, no lows, must be Bose. The Bose sound has always been my least favorite. Clear, midrange, just baffling why people like it. Maybe my ears are damaged, but just not for me. Then I read a review. I took the plunge. No kidding - the noise cancelling on these is as good as the Sony over-the-ear models. My test for noise cancelling is taking the earbuds for a walk. I do a few miles around the neighborhood every day - and after the Sony's entered my life, the 'clomp clomp clomp' of my footsteps with any other earbud/headphone has driven me crazy. I put these on last night and played a few tracks on Tidal Master Quality - Beatles, Prince, some classical, and there it was. That midrange Bose sound that drives me batty. I switched between these and the Sony's - and the Sony's sound great with no tweaking. They just sound great. I have fallen in love with pipe organ recordings because of the Sony's I think. I love the way the recordings sound and feel in the Sony's. No way these Bose are going to cross this hurdle of sounding like Bose. It's just what they are, not my taste. This morning I tweaked the EQ on my phone to make the Bose less Bose-sounding, and started on my walk, and I couldn't hear my footsteps. I couldn't hear my 'clomp clomp clomp.' Oh my goodness. Why do these have to be Bose! These things are a miracle. A miracle. So I dug into my phone's sound settings a little more and saw they have different sound settings for people, depending on their age. I clicked on my age (none of your business!) and the Bose sounded better. More in line with what I'm used to. I played a pipe organ piece and it didn't sound as full as the Sony's but it was fine. It passed my test. I have read the Bose doesn't use the fancy high-quality codecs the Sony's use. I could hear sound degradation on quieter passages of a classical recording - but I looked at the recording and it was on a not top-tier label, so maybe it was just an average recording. But the bottom line is - after returning several pairs of earbuds for the reasons spelled out above, I am actually going to keep these. I discovered the Bose app has its own EQ which tweaks the sound a little better than my phone's. There is also a mode where it cancels the sound I want canceled ('clomp clomp clomp'), yet I could hear cars approaching and my feet crinkling leaves in the street. Fantastic!"

These earbuds have really good sound and noise canceling! I already have the Sony WF-SP800N earbuds, but the Bose are better in both categories! But where I like the Sony better than Bose is, the Sony buds will auto-connect to the last device I was connected to, and the Bose only seem to auto-connect to my phone but only if it were the last thing I was connected to before putting them back in the charging case. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I don't think so. The bad: with the Bose is a few times the left bit would not play anything at all. I'd reset it over and over again with no luck! Then it would work fine the next day. Actually, I don't even currently have the Bose earbuds in possession because the left earbud all of a sudden started blasting static and then a very loud crackling noise started happening that made me tense up and jerk the earbud out of my ear because it hurt my ear pretty bad. The crackling wasn't constant, but it happened every couple of seconds and even with the volume turned down, it was loud! And this pretty much made the left bud useless. I don't think anything but the static and crackling sound was coming out of it. The good news - Bose seems to have pretty good customer service/warranty because I did a few clicks on their website explaining the issue and they're replacing these QC 2s with a pair of the Ultras!! So while it sucks to have to go without the buds after paying that price for them, at least I'm getting an upgrade and I still have the Sony's to hold me over. The Sony's are bulky, but I actually still really like them and these 800s (I don't think they make them anymore) never fall out of my ear! And I run every single day."

The software is genuinely bad. There genuinely are connectivity issues. Not so much the headphones have a hard time pairing with my phone (yet), but rather simply that the app can only access the settings for the headphones, or even find the headphones, about 20% of the time. In a lot of use cases that doesn't really matter. This is a new toy, however, and I kind of want to play with the settings. You know, it would be nice to know exactly what this thing can and can't do. Can't figure that out if I can't access it in the app. I'm thinking about returning. Honestly, I don't want to because the hardware is so very good. The noise cancellation is truly superb. Reference point for me would be the Pixel Buds Pro and Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2. Also Pixel Buds Hey series, but those don't have ANC, so as a reference point... I'm not really sure how it serves. Anyway, I think I might have no choice but to return if the software update (which is really hard to apply without being able to access settings in the app) doesn't fix the problems and having, which incidentally have everything to do with... accessing settings in the app."

My original review of this product wasn’t great, to say the least, but I do want to add this info as I just completed my warranty claim with Bose on these earbuds and I’m very happy with the outcome. My original review is still available below, and although I do still have the same feelings for this exact product, the problem was rectified by the manufacturer. I contacted Bose with the issue I was having and was emailed a shipping label to return the earbuds and was offered their newest model (QuietComfort Ultra) as a replacement. Within 7 business days of me sending my earbuds in to Bose, I have received the new product which came brand new in the original packaging, and for this, I’m beyond grateful. I decided to leave my original two-star rating, however, because it pertains to the original earbuds that were a nightmare. If I were to review the new model they had sent as a replacement, it would be 5 stars though! Original review (before warranty replacement): Let me start by saying that I am a huge Bose fan and would consider myself very loyal to the brand. The very first product I purchased was the 3-2-1 home entertainment system probably around 17 years or so ago, and since then if it has anything to do with speakers for me, it is most definitely a Bose product. This even includes my vehicle, which I am thrilled that Cadillac always has Bose speakers installed. As for earbud headphones, I started with the Bose SoundSport model and they were great. Unfortunately, after almost a year and a half of heavy use, the batteries were shot and only lasted about 30 minutes on a full charge, so I upgraded to the QuietComfort model, which I also loved. Unfortunately, after owning those for a year, the glue that held them together began to break down and one of them separated into two pieces and would no longer play sound. For the amount I use these, I don't think that them only lasting a year was that bad. I basically wear them for at least an hour every single day and most days 4+ hours. It was after the QuietComforts fell apart that I purchased these QuietComfort II series earbuds, and the first thing I noticed was that there didn't seem to be much of an upgrade in sound quality, or at least it wasn't as noticeable as the upgrade from the SoundSports to the first QuietComfort model. After a few days of using them, they began to constantly lose connection to my iPhone & iPad, and most of the time when this happens, a simple reset won't fix the issue and they refuse to connect to any of my devices. I've tried everything to correct this when it happens, forget them in my phone's settings, erase them from my Bose Music app, etc. Nothing corrects it other than time. After a few hours of being in their case, they will connect again after being removed, but this is happening more frequently than not, and it is extremely annoying. They also very recently started doing this thing where the sound gets all distorted while using them, and then it will start playing sound from only one side for a few seconds, and then it will switch to the other side and back continuously for a minute or so. It just really shocks me that I had absolutely zero complaints on any of my previous Bose earbud models, and here I am having a nightmare of a time with these QuietComfort IIs. I did notice there is a new series/model out now (QuietComfort Ultra), and I really wish my QuietComfort 1s lasted just another two months or so as I would've just purchased whatever the newest model was at that time, but to now spend another $300.00+/- after just spending $275.00 on these only four months ago is very upsetting, as well as the thought that the new model might also not be the same tremendous quality that I believed my previous Bose earbuds were. To tie up this review, I can't say enough good things about Bose products; however, I would personally stay away from this model as they've been nothing but issues for me since the very first few times that I used them."

For the noise-canceling feature, Bose QC II's are comfortable and do not fall out! They fit, they function, and they last while standing up to the rigors of my daily life.

But for $300 when comparing to AirPods Pro 2, AirPods takes it. I wear earbuds all day for 4-6 hours at a time, I’m an automotive technician so I would use the noise cancellation features quite a bit. I do love that the noise cancellation is adjustable, and both the AirPods Pro 2 and Bose QuietComfort 2 have an adaptive transparency mode that allows all noise in but protects from noises above 90 decibels, which in the automotive industry is pretty much every air tool we use. When Bose activates this feature it sounds robotic and changes your listening audio, makes it sound odd for a second or two, Apple is much smoother when their adaptive transparency works. Also many more features with the Apple earbuds, from 3 charging methods and Find My features, Bose only has one which is cable charging. AirPods can completely turn off transparency or noise cancellation, Bose cannot. My biggest reason for ultimately choosing AirPods Pro 2 was the comfort, the Bose earbuds began to chafe my ears after about 1.5 hours, the AirPods I can go for 5+ before I notice any discomfort. So side by side with features the Apple AirPods will win this hands down, but… if you’re an audiophile, the sound quality you get from Bose is unbeatable and Apple doesn’t come close, also the adjustability of the degree of noise cancellation is a fantastic Bose feature, but other than that, the AirPods won me out, mainly due to their integration into iOS UI. I’m sure if I had an Android I would stick with the Bose option but Apple made sure the AirPods work flawlessly with their iOS devices. Last thing I will mention, maybe it was just my set, but they were a bit buggy. What happened was, in 5 days of owning, they connected 6 times but played no audio, I had to set them back in their case and start over for that to remedy, also for the first 15 seconds after you put them in, the tap controls are very buggy, either severely delayed response or no response, once they’ve been in your ears for over a minute they work perfectly. Last annoyance was using tap controls, when using it’s almost like an even slight tap on the earbuds is amplified and is obnoxiously loud, I thought maybe I was tapping too hard, but with AirPods Gen 1, which are all tap controlled, the action of tapping on the side produces no real noise. I’m telling you, the tap on the side sounds like a balloon popping at a distance of 15-20 ft away every time, it was very difficult to overlook that during my use. You literally have to delicately tap the side to have no audio discomfort, with AirPods I will literally tap with my buckles if my hands are dirty and I get no audible discomfort, no shockingly loud tap, so I don’t know if it is physically transferring the noise in or the noise transparency is interpreting the tapping as a noise and just amplifying this for your ears, either way it’s highly annoying and was the ultimate deal breaker for me."

I mainly got these because I had surgery and needed to sleep, but I'm a very light sleeper. Bose has changed that. I was taking a nap and my husband brought in a fan, ladder, and toolbox to replace our existing fan, and I did not hear a thing. My only challenge is I am a side sleeper, so I ordered a pillow with a hole in it designed for people who have had ear piercings to sleep. Even if I have to sleep on my back, they are totally worth it! They connect out of the case, and the touch controls are just sensitive enough. Bluetooth connection was easy and fast."

I really like the noise cancellation. I can understand audiobooks while mowing the yard. But... I've always had trouble with finding earbuds that fit both ears. Usually, either left or right just doesn't feel secure, and this is no different (I probably have a dozen pairs, including AirPods Pro). Because they're expensive, I was on the fence on whether to keep them or return them, but the noise cancellation works well. I did find the extra-large wings (maybe they call them stabilizers—and have to be ordered from Bose—$10, I think) helped with the left bud. The right feels okay with the stabilizer that comes with the package. They look a little large. Audio level can be adjusted by sliding your finger up/down on the earbud, and the quiet mode works well mowing the yard and at the gym."

I've had these earbuds for 6 months now. Sound quality is the best I've ever heard from earbuds. I also love the equalizer capabilities in the app. On the downside, they fall out of my ears on a regular basis. I've used every combination of earplugs and cross-support with no luck. I even bought the reverse Vulcan-looking supports bought separately. They worked as far as hold, but I lost all bass and high tones with those. Advice? Only use these when you are lying on pillows in bed. Not sure how long they will last falling six feet to concrete every 15 minutes on walks. Definitely don't wear these while exercising."

The packaging and the overall build quality of the headphones are nice for sure. I was genuinely surprised about the sound quality and immediate bass that hits you right off the bat, and that's without the Bose app EQ. Speaking of the app, the app is complete garbage. It did not identify the headphones at all to pair with my phone, and it wasn't until the last second of giving up that it finally paired. Honestly, after using the EQ settings to keep them at my preferred sound, I deleted the app immediately. The microphone quality is super questionable as well. Whenever you're in a call, it'll pick up every single sound around you no matter how loud, and it'll transfer it to the receiving end of the person you're in a call with, making it very hard to deal with and them not being able to hear any word you say. It also drops Bluetooth pairing pretty frequently, which made me think it was the pair of headphones I had received. But it wasn't, it's this model in general. I have the same issue even with the new pair. Be careful being around very loud sudden noises too, the mic will try to dim the audio but in return, it'll basically pop your eardrum in the process. Overall, I do kinda regret buying these headphones although sound quality and build quality are exceptional. I feel like there are way better headphones out there with no issues at all at the same price point that don't use a garbage app."

I had a previous generation of Bose noise-cancelling, in-ear headphones that I had misplaced, so I ordered these expecting an improvement upon the ones I had grown to love. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to discover that they are very difficult to fit into my ears in such a way that they will reliably stay put while exercising or walking. They require a twist to sort of lock into place, and none of the provided inserts seem to work for my ears. Any jostling, especially if you're at all sweaty, will cause them to work loose and fall out. What's more, they rely on a tight seal in the ear for the noise cancelling to really work, and that can be very hard to achieve. After buying them, I located my old ones, so I've had a chance to compare them side-by-side by going back and forth, and I honestly prefer my old ones to these. These do have slightly better sound quality, and perhaps better battery life, but honestly what does that matter if they don't stay put? I still use them on the airplane, where they aren't likely to fall out, but I don't bother using them while exercising."

I'm very sad to be switching over. I thought these QCs would stay in the ear as well as the SoundSport design, but sadly they don't even compare. Setting up the buds is fairly easy but tedious. Bose QC 2 Pros: - Good sound quality when both headphones are in your ear. - Completely reduces outside noise; it's incredible. - Mic is great during phone calls. Cons: - Hard to hear a call with just one headphone in. - App updates/issues = connectivity issues. - QC buds' earpieces get significantly greasier than the SoundSport's earpieces. - I have small ears, and these feel like they're going to fall out. - Not as durable. When I was trying to fit these, they fell on the floor twice and were scratched both times. My SoundSports have been dropped many times in 4 years and still look brand new. I actually prefer the in-ear design on the SoundSport buds so much. Even though they look bulky in the ear, they never fell out and stayed in very well. I think going smaller on the buds was a huge downfall for people with smaller ears. Very disappointed with my upgrade; I was trying to stay loyal to Bose, but I think I should have tried the Beats Pro buds 😮‍💨."

I have had them for over 1 year now, and the sound is still amazing. It's Bose, so I wouldn't expect anything less. Battery life is decent. The noise canceling is right on par. I use them at work as it's really loud, and they do a great job at blocking the noise. The main problem I have with them is they will disconnect while using them. I have to reset them very often, sometimes 4 times in a 12-hour shift. It's simple to reset them, but for the price, I shouldn't have to. I would recommend them to others who are looking for a good set of earbuds, just be prepared to have them lose connection with your phone."

So I have been torn on what to buy and have been reading and reading reviews for weeks now. I finally decided it down to these and Beats Fit Pro. I really like these and honestly between the two you really can't tell much difference. The noise cancellation is a tiny bit better in the Bose, but the sound and bass response is better in the Beats. It honestly came down to one deciding factor, the button to change songs and control the earbuds. On the Beats, you actually have a button you can feel that clicks instead of the Bose where you just touch the outside. Obviously with the Beats, it's very responsive with the button feel, the Bose were actually more difficult to control. Sometimes when you pressed it twice to change the song, it would put it on pause, and pressing it three times would only change the song to the next track instead of repeating or taking you back a track. The Beats seem to fit a bit better than the Bose as well. Also, the Beats were $50 cheaper, honestly not a deal-breaker either way, but it was added to the pros when I started adding everything up against the two. Overall my choice after about a week of comparing the two were the Beats. I actually really wanted to like the Bose more because I have grown up with Bose and always had their products, but at the end of the day, Beats came out on top. FYI, my wife also compared them and felt the same way and liked the Beats better."

I bought these last-generation Bose earbuds on sale one day and I'm so happy that I did. I have always loved the Bose quality, so I had no qualms about their sound. One complaint I've read about is that you cannot only wear one earbud, or cannot only wear the left earbud. I'm here to tell you, in June 2024, you absolutely can. Also, the battery life is amazing since the case recharges every time you put the buds away. I honestly haven't used them for calls yet, but I didn't buy them for that reason, only for music and podcasts. I was torn between buying these and the new ultra-open Bose earbuds, but I'm pretty happy with these and the noise cancellation. I haven't used them traveling, but in a normal household or work environment, they have great noise cancellation. I'm very happy with my purchase!"

These are good, wish I hadn't wasted my time with other brands and just bit the bullet and got these first. The only negative is that the case they are in is slippery. It keeps slipping out of my hands, and when the case hits the floor, the top opens and the buds spill out. A textured case and a stronger spring on the flip cap. Otherwise very nice. I wear mine on the plane, mowing the lawn, and splitting wood with the splitter. It knocks the noise down substantially, even blocks annoying conversations in a crowded room. Not bulky. Six-month update: still sound great. The little rubber band that surrounds the earbud to make it easier to get out of the case easily falls off and gets lost. The buds need to be reseated in your ear every so often or they fall out, resulting in having to chase it across the floor. Most annoying is they don't seat very well in the charging case all the time. This results in staying connected to your phone and all calls going to it. It also discharges the earbuds so they are dead when you need them. Battery life is good. I wear them an hour every morning at the gym, and when doing other stuff aside from calls. Next time I'll get ones that loop over the ear so I don't have to run after them when they fall out."

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The bass is completely distorted and the mids and highs are horrible. Had to send them back and just ended up keeping my SoundSports. Update: So I thought it was strange how distorted the bass was on my first pair so I decided to try again. I was right! It appears the first pair was sent damaged and the sound was night and day without any distortion. Below I will list the pros and cons as to why I still decided to return the second pair. Pros: - Incredible sound. You pick up sounds and quality in songs you've never even noticed before. Whole new experience. - Touch controls are seamless and make it very easy for controlling. - Noise cancellation is the best I've experienced for any earbuds I have ever tried. - Snug fit so if you want to use for running or sports. Cons: - Not as compatible with Apple products as traditional AirPods. You have to use physical controls to activate Siri and noise cancellation. Can't be done by voice. - Starts to hurt ears after 30+ minutes of use due to how snug they fit. Ear hooks on Bose SoundSports are much better. - Bigger charging case than most earbuds that don't show battery life without having to access the app and no wireless charging. Must use USB-C for charging. - You can only create one shortcut per earbud with long press. - Noise cancellation is only to block out sounds you can hear but does not cancel out background noises to listeners for phone calls. They can hear all background noises if you're in a loud office or environment."

I have always been a fan of the original Bose QuietComfort earbuds, which I have enjoyed for a few years. When I temporarily misplaced them, I decided to pull the trigger on the new Bose QuietComfort earbuds II. When I first got them, I was stunned! The sound quality was amazing, surpassing the already incredible first generation. The resolution was so good I was picking up nuances of sound never heard before in songs I had listened to for many years. The noise cancelling was even better than the first generation. The bass left me wondering how there could be so much impact happening inside my ear. Sound quality was 6 out of 5 stars. But then I noticed a firmware update in the Bose app. I foolishly thought that what was perfect could become even better. Wow, was I wrong. Shortly after the update, I noticed some random anomalies. For a split second, the sound would warp, almost as if the sync between the two buds skewed between stereo and mono. At first, I thought it was just a random glitch in the source material, but this proved not to be the case. The issue became more frequent and proved consistent on other devices with multiple sources. I officially had a defective product. Bose support was quick to exchange the earbuds for a new pair. They sent me a shipping label and were quick to ship on their end once they received my old set. I did not realize at the time that the new firmware was the issue. So when I got the new pair, guess what I did? Yep, updated the firmware right out of the box. Predictably, the same issue occurred with the new set. At this point, I did what I should have the first time around and researched the issue online. It did not take long to find that many others were having the same problem since the update. The second call to Bose went similar to the first with a quick resolution to replace the headphones. I am now waiting for the new ones and hope they have an older firmware version on them. Unfortunately, the Bose rep was not able to do anything but follow their script and had no information about if they were working on a fix for the firmware. I'm sure this is a known issue and hope that they address it soon. If Bose fixes their glitchy firmware, then I will update this review and the buds will score a solid 5 stars."

I really wanted to like these earbuds. I was upgrading from a less expensive noise-canceling pair because the noise-canceling on those was okay but not amazing. I tried to do my research because these aren't cheap, and I am a fan of Bose products. The pros: the sound on these was really good, and so was the noise-canceling. I liked that I could customize the controls for each earbud, to a point, and I liked how well it drowned out ambient noise when I activated the noise canceling. Even when I didn't have music playing, they would still muffle the sounds around me. The touch controls did take a minute to get used to, but it was nice to be able to control the volume from the earbuds, which is something I couldn't do on my old pair. Now the negatives. The connection problems that everyone talks about are valid. I only used these with my phone, and after a week they started to get weird with connecting to it. I tested the connection with one earbud, both earbuds and the problem seemed to be if I was consistently taking one in and out of the case. It's worth noting that the range on these if I walked away without my phone, was not very far. Another complaint I saw in the comments was the voice assistant that talks to you. I personally didn't have a problem because if you have any other product in the Bose family, namely the speakers, it's exactly the same with announcing the battery life and when you're connecting to a phone. The voice also doesn't come in too loud so that was not a concern for me. At the end of the day, the reason I returned them was because the earbuds were painful for me to wear. I tried every combination imaginable with the given interchangeable parts. None of them solved the problem and it just hurt too much to wear them for any extended period of time (an hour was about my limit). I do have small ears, so this is probably where the problem came from, but I tried the earbuds without the pieces that cover where the sound comes out (not sure what else to call it) and they were still too long. I get why they are priced so high, I do. I'm just disappointed that I spent that much money on something that ultimately didn't work. Definitely should've done more research on their comfort."

Let me tell you the saga of my earbud journey. I have very small ears and have never found a pair of earbuds that fits comfortably, stays in, and doesn't cause me any pain. I had a pair of UE Fits, because those buds were the only ones I've found that were mildly comfortable (but they still fell out and felt too large) so when UE came out with their custom-built Drops earbuds, I ecstatically tried them. To my great disappointment, they could not size my ears and told me that their custom buds would never work for me. That made me give up all hope that I would be able to find comfortable earbuds, but I was determined to find some that at least didn't fall out like my UE Fits, and were higher quality (since the UE Fits feel sort of flimsy and cheap, really) and after much research I decided to try these, but my expectations were low. I did not expect them to work. Boy, have I never been so wrong in my life! These are amazing!!! They are extremely comfortable - absolutely no pain. I can fall asleep with them in my ears and they are still there when I wake up. The sound quality and noise cancellation is better than any other headphone or earbuds I have ever tried. They feel durable and high-quality - they work like a charm. I am absolutely in love. I never want to take them out of my ears because they give me such peaceful quiet, but are comfortable enough that I forget they are even there. I do wish they had multipoint as I tend to use two devices at once fairly frequently, but I am hopeful that they will come out with an update about that sometime in the future. Wireless charging would also be nice, but it's totally not a requirement. Other than that, I have absolutely no complaints. It's also worth noting that they seem well-protected in their case. The magnets are good and, unlike my UE Fits that drop out of my case super easily, these have strong magnets that keep them well in place so I feel more comfortable taking them places. If you have small ears, I'd definitely recommend trying these. They are the best ones I have ever found and I have tried a lot of earbuds, including custom-made ones, that did not work at all. These have so many different configurations you can alter and shift, which means they really do have a size for everyone. Plus, they are high quality with almost all of the modern-day features you would expect them to have. TL;DR: As someone with weird ears that don't even work with custom earbuds, these are perfect. I never want to take them off."

However, I noticed, during quiet parts of the music, there was white noise clearly noticeable being generated by the earbuds. I followed all of the recommendations from Bose to no avail. The left earbud was intolerable while the right one was acceptable. Bose is aware of the issue but considers it a normal experience according to their packaged and online troubleshooting. I do have tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and the hiss was loud enough to be noticeable. Went to Reddit and plenty of similar reports despite multiple returns. No online videos really mentioned it so I was unaware of the problem when purchasing it. I returned them. Also, shipping took “forever” as a Prime member. I ordered on a Tuesday evening and didn’t receive them until the next Monday evening. I miss the two-day delivery that used to exist. When I called about it on Saturday, the Amazon customer service said they would expedite it and have it delivered Sunday. Obviously just mollifying me. Oh, well, minor inconvenience, but the principle is disquieting, no pun intended. Really wanted to like them. They don’t sound that much better than Soundcore earbuds I’ve owned for half the price. Actually, my P3 quieted more of my lawn tractor's noise than the Bose did, and seemed to deal better with sudden noises than the Bose. Really disappointed. Also, no way to disengage the noise-canceling feature, so I couldn’t just enjoy the audio performance without the hiss. Also, no true multipoint, despite the chipset supporting it and Bose adding it to the Ultra model as a software update. Overall, the software onboard the earbuds and the software on the phone were both substandard and hinky. I don’t think I’ll buy another Bose headphone product again. It’s kind of a shame, really. I always looked forward to buying a premium brand of headphone and was really disappointed by the entire Bose experience. And, as a coup de grâce, the return (after being sent via UPS Store) was started today, July 15th, and estimates that the refund will occur on August 15th. I’m going to find out if Bose is the seller, as both the delivery and return arrangements were well outside my expectations."

I purchased these primarily because I’ve owned and have loved everything about my experience with the Bose QC35II headphones. Also, the reviews about the audio quality from those who have used competing brands and especially from those who have compared the Bose earbuds to the Bose headphones made me relatively certain that I would be satisfied with the audio quality of these earbuds. The connectivity features of the Bose earbuds, however, are lacking. Things that you think should work intuitively don’t always. For example, the earbuds don’t automatically connect to the last source they were connected to when you put them away, and there is no way to select a different (paired) source using the touch-sensitive controls on the earbuds. Instead, you have to go to your TV or PC or phone’s Bluetooth settings to connect the earbuds, and that isn’t always as reliable as you would expect. I don’t like having to rely on using an app or placing the earbuds in the case to switch sources. A glaring omission with the app is that while it does provide charge level indications for each earbud, why is there no charge level indication for the case?! It’s very annoying to place your discharged earbuds in the case for an hour, thinking they will be fully charged, only to remove them from the case and discover that you only have less than a full charge, sometimes far less than a full charge, because the case ran out of power. There is no way of knowing how much charge remains in the case. I hope that Bose updates the app to add an indicator for case charge level, if the case hardware even supports doing that. It may not even be possible, and that would be an even greater disappointment. All things considered, I am very happy with the Bose QC earbuds II. They sound amazing, fit well, deliver best-in-class noise reduction, provide a decent feature set, and are ultimately worth the high price of admission as long as they provide me with this level of enjoyment for at least as many years as my Bose QC35 II headphones have done."

The other day, right before a business trip, I managed to lose one of my Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro and was ready to order a replacement pair. As far as I knew, they were great - except that I could never get the fit quite right, no matter what replacement size (and brand) tips I tried. Which means that a yawn or sometimes talking was enough for one to fall out, and when I went on runs, it was always a little iffy. Being a Bose fan, I decided to try these out. I own the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, which were a must on long flights as the above-mentioned buds did not cancel the noise quite as much as I would like, which I attributed to being a bud. I was hesitant as I have had some connection issues with Bose (when it connects to two devices), but in the end, I opted for these. Hands down, these are the best purchase ever. Out of the box, the fit was great. I can yawn, shake my head, run, etc., and both buds feel secure. Even better, I barely notice that they are there. The noise cancelling is the best I have ever experienced - better than my now three-year-old Bose 700 over-the-ear headphones. On the plane, a simple touch goes from aware when I'm ordering a drink to noise cancellation, which is outstanding - even the PA announcements are severely muffled and very low decibel. While I have not played with creating new modes, know that you can if you have particular needs for environments. The touch controls are intuitive and easy to use - somehow I find it easier than with the Samsung buds and Bose over-ear headphones, but maybe I am just biased and excited with these new ones. And the sound quality? Also amazing. I'm no expert on this front, but I can say it is superior to both my over-the-ear Bose (which to me were the gold standard), misc. Bluetooth speakers I have, and the Samsung buds. I cannot describe it. As for connectivity issues - so far all is good, though I am not sure I know all the details yet (like if they can connect to two devices and the auto connection). One thing that made me hesitate was how waterproof they are, but in the end, I realized at most they would experience rain, maybe a quick drop in the snow (not likely as I'd have a hat or headband on), and sweat. These are rated for those kinds of water interactions. I've never dropped headphones or earbuds in water or needed them to survive being submerged, and I do not see that changing, so I am not worried. Overall, I would say they are worth the increased price over others."

I purchased these with hopes of better managing my severe hyperacusis. That means very normal sounds are quite painful to my ears. The sound canceling on these earbuds is shockingly good. Shockingly good. You could be sitting right by a fan, and that noise is going to disappear completely. I can use earplugs in the real world, but then I can't really hear what people are saying. These earbuds work as they should; they cancel a lot of outside noise while still allowing you to speak and hear within an acceptable range. That is life-changing for me. The app is frustrating to use so far. These things demand to be paired, even though they don't need to be paired to anything in order to work with the sound canceling. So, I have to pair them to the app and then mute the app in order to use them like they would if no app existed. And it's not even the app that the earbuds themselves demand to be paired to a device. I don't want that, but I haven't yet found a workaround. Because if I don't have Wi-Fi or I'm not in an area where they can be paired, then they just constantly bark to be paired. It's very unnecessary and very annoying. It's possible that I will find solutions as these are quite new to me. I don't know what the sound quality is like; frankly, I don't care. These are strictly sound-muting devices for me, and for that purpose, they seem to be very effective. I have used other devices for this, and everything coming up short."

I really, really wanted to like these. I have the previous models which I really loved, but I figured with a new model it must be better in every way. When I first got them, that seemed to be the case. The noise canceling was definitely an improvement. The audio quality was also improved. The comfort was good but not great. However, as time went on, I find that this new fit system just doesn’t work for me in my right ear. I’ve switched back and forth between all the sizes of the earplug and wing, but over time the right one just finds its way out of my ear and will literally fall out of my head. For an expensive pair of earbuds, this can be kind of annoying. No, very annoying. I really think Bose should’ve stuck with the previous fit system and improved upon it as opposed to going back to a more traditional wing system. The old system, while not perfect, was very comfortable and never fell out of my head. So it’s truly unfortunate that this new model is better in some ways and worse in others. Another issue is there are also synchronicity issues for the first few minutes after you put them on. The older model did not have this problem at all. I suspect this is because Bose caved under pressure to get independent channels to each ear, and this causes some issues because this wasn’t happening until they updated the buds to support independent listening with either bud. As time goes by, these are getting progressively worse, and I should’ve just stuck with the previous model, which makes the previous model a great deal to buy. If you just want a really good pair of noise-canceling earbuds, the noise canceling isn’t quite as good as this model, but it’s more than adequate, so I would say, save yourself some money and buy the previous model. I hope Bose goes back to the previous design and makes it a bit lighter and more compact instead of going with this new model wing system because it’s just not as good as the old one. It’s also more complicated and harder to get a good fit. Given the higher price and a step back on quality, I am giving a pretty low score, but this is because the previous model is better and this one was more expensive, so comparatively the previous model gets five stars, but this one gets three. P.S. Whoever’s idea it was to make the bottom of the case round so that you can never stand it on end? What? Considering that you have to leave the case open while checking status and setting up Bluetooth? It’s this kind of design decision that just begs the question, what were you thinking, Bose?"

I started out with Bose over-the-ear headphones twenty years ago so I could sleep while a construction project was happening next door. Those had great noise canceling for the time and good sound, but most importantly, the quality was there. Next, I purchased the 1st gen wired earbuds. Those had better noise canceling and sound, but I had to replace them under warranty because there was a problem with wires shorting out. Next, I got the Bose QuietComfort wireless noise-canceling earbuds. Noise canceling was much improved, as was sound quality. With those, which by the way I still have, never a single problem whatsoever. Quality took a turn for the better. Consequently, I had similar expectations for these, the QuietComfort Earbuds II. The design was smaller, as was the case. The latter was an improvement, much easier to open. Once I got the tips and sealer pieces in place, I immediately noticed how much the sound had improved over the previous-gen QuietComfort buds. Even better, somehow they improved noise cancellation a great deal. Sounds, frequencies the others weren't able to do a good job blocking, these did effortlessly. As to comfort, they are still good in that respect but not so much as the previous-gen buds. Then we get to the battery and charging. The newest iteration of buds, when fully charged and with noise canceling active, last approximately an hour longer than the earlier version of wireless buds. That's where the good ends and a very serious flaw comes into play. More often than not, I go to use what's supposed to be a fully charged case to hear them say not 100% but somewhere between 30-60%. Even with the case left plugged in with the buds inserted, it makes no difference. Then related, they frequently won't disconnect from my devices unbeknownst to me based on outward appearances. So yet again, Bose quality takes the downward path. I want to love these earbuds, but if they don't charge reliably, what's the point of having them to begin with? I've searched online and found many customers experiencing the exact same issues. The few possible solutions didn't fix things at my end or the majority of those who posted online in help forums, Reddit, etc. All said I would not buy these again and have been disappointed too many times to remain a loyal Bose customer. My next earbud purchase will not be from Bose; I'm done giving them chances."

The noise cancellation is unbelievable. The problem? Getting them to stay connected. I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max, an MSI WS-75 workstation laptop, and an HP Envy laptop that I have the Bose QC Earbuds 2 connected to. I followed all of the instructions, yet in my office, the earbuds will stay connected to my iPhone for just shy of 2 minutes. I reconnected them 8 times before I switched to the MSI laptop - and that wasn't much better. I have resynced them several times, I have cycled the power on the phone repeatedly...in other words, I have done everything that I have read to do (and the Bose website is not much help). I am going to try for another week before I send them back. (I am currently on my front porch with Walter the cat, and they have now stayed connected to the iPhone for about 8 minutes). I want to love these (I have had a pair of wired in-ear Bose earbuds for 8 or 10 years and love them) - the noise canceling has literally changed my life (I am riddled with ADD and these help me stay on task when working), but if I can't get them to stay connected, I am going to send them back and shop for something else. Update: one week exactly and I have initiated a return from Amazon - they are so annoying I could not use them any longer. When you start looking for answers online about the connection issue (the only issue I had with them), you find that this is very, very common, and the only workaround that Bose has is resync them, and they want to blame interference. When I am away from anything that can cause interference, with my iPhone sitting on the table in front of me and they won't stay connected for longer than a couple of minutes...there is something more going on than interference.

These earbuds sound great, and the noise cancellation technology is very impressive. Even if I do not have any sound playing at the moment, I found it difficult to even have a conversation with someone while wearing the earbuds with quiet mode enabled. The battery life was great, and I also was able to get a great fit in my ears through trial and error with the various included sizes (historically I have had trouble with other brand earbuds staying in place). With all of that said, I had two different poor experiences with these buds. First, every now and then the audio would have some weird quirk where the sound had an echo (for lack of a better word) and sounded off. It typically just lasted a few seconds and would happen randomly. That bug was annoying, though if that were the only issue, I would have likely ignored it. My much more significant bad experience with these earbuds involves connectivity issues. I used these with two different devices, and switching back and forth between devices was pretty simple. After a few weeks, however, my earbuds would randomly completely stop working with either one or both of the devices, and I would have to reconnect and pair them with the device again. The connectivity issue kept getting worse over time, where I had to attempt multiple restarts and pairings to get them to work again, and it got to the point where it would lose that connection after just a few days. This was too much for me, so I ultimately returned them. In summary, to the extent my earbuds were not uniquely defective, if these bugs are worked out, the earbuds are otherwise an excellent choice."

In short, I love these things. They are more comfortable to wear than the first-gen Bose QC, and the performance is better. The sound quality and noise cancellation are absolutely fantastic and better than the QC I. I had some issues with pairing the QC I buds with devices that could not install the app, but these pair fine, app or not. Range from the source seems slightly better as well. The app is pretty good if limited in function. I very much appreciate the ability to select another source in the app (even if I need to connect it to the device I am using first). Occasionally, the app is not able to find the earbuds if I open the app before I take an earbud out of the case, but that's easily fixed. My biggest complaint about functions is that you have only two options when it comes to a shortcut (either changing the mode or activating the voice assistant—pretty lame—I'd like to see more options there. The microphone has very good fidelity, but it picks up every single little breeze. That makes it, at least, very irritating when trying to talk to someone on the phone while outside, and it can even be nearly impossible. That really needs to be fixed. I've yet to run the battery dry, so I cannot comment on battery life. However, it seems to be at least as good as advertised if you can trust its own assessment of how much charge remains. But that brings us to the only real, glaring disadvantage over the QC I. The QC II case does not have wireless charging. I don't know what's going on with that or who thought that was a good idea. Every other friggin' premium earbuds I've seen in the last five years (or more) have wireless charging. I know it's already a large case, but I think we'd all be fine with one slightly larger enough to accommodate wireless charging."

Short review: an upgrade in every way to their previous earbuds. Better noise cancellation, better charging case, at least as good of fit (it feels just as secure as the last ones in my ears). Usable for long periods of time without discomfort (the previous ones would hurt my ear after a while), I have used these from full to zero twice now without any notable discomfort. The sound is at least on par with the previous version, my brain says it's better but my mind says it's about the same. Overall I like them better than AirPods, but I would not recommend these over AirPods for another reason; see below. My experience with these Bose earbuds: at first, quite happy; used them with no issues for several weeks. The case slips my hand and falls to the floor one day, and one earbud stops working as a result; returned the unit and got a replacement, no fuss; props to Bose there. Second unit goes same as the first, I use it for a few weeks but then instead of dropping the whole case, I drop one earbud while sitting in a car. The earbud did not break entirely, but now it has a persistent scratching noise that happens about a minute after it powers on. Tried various different fixes, nothing worked; I have now sent that one in for replacement as of writing. Assuming they send me a third unit, I will apparently need to be supremely careful in my handling of these extremely delicate earbuds. Between the second unit breaking and me returning it for replacement, I waited a couple of months, instead using some Apple AirPods daily. Like I mentioned above, I like the Bose earbuds better in a vacuum. Comes down to personal preference; they are not really much better than each other in any aspect other than durability. Over the course of two months using the AirPods daily, I have dropped the entire case two or three times and individual buds once or twice. No breaking, no malfunctioning, no visible damage. This is especially strange considering I had Bose's previous QC earbuds, the first version; I still do have them, and they have been subjected to way more abuse than these newer QC buds and the AirPods combined and still function just fine. Something about the new design, while better than the first design, just isn't durable enough for day-to-day use. I would recommend the Apple AirPods instead."

I decided on the QC2 after trying Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, and Audio-Technica ATH-TWX9. The Audio-Technica have a better sound signature (for my liking) and have the look and feel of a $300 earbud. The mid and highs have a brilliance that the others I tried don't. However, I could only get them to seal using aftermarket tips that were uncomfortable, and the noise cancelling was mid-tier at best. The Bose had alternate tips and stability bands, XXS and XL, on their website, and I needed the XL. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable. Other manufacturers should take note. Another no-brainer for a flagship earbud would be wireless charging, which Bose does not support. Not a deal-breaker for me but another miss. The Bose Connect app is, frankly, not good. The apps for all of the buds I tried were better, and they stayed connected. The QC2 box states Made for iPhone, works with Android. I would assume that the app problems might be better with iPhone but is very frustrating using my S22 Ultra. I have to connect to it numerous times throughout the day, and at least once a week, I have to repair the buds to my phone as the app can't find the device, although it is actually paired to the phone. I would also like at least a 5-band equalizer in place of the 3-band. Another shortcoming is codec support. While the QC2 supports SBC and AAC, it lacks any type of aptX or the higher resolution LDAC. Hopefully, this will be corrected in an upcoming firmware update. Bottom line for me is I can, for a while, tolerate the poor app because of the really good noise cancelling, very good audio quality, and a really great fit. If we can get aptX HD or lossless and invest some money into the Connect app, these will be hard to top. Update: I have been using these steadily for 3 weeks now and must say I'm quite impressed. After tweaking using the equalizer, the sound is excellent. I can wear these for hours and actually forget I have them in. The noise cancelling is world-class. I've learned to live with the app, although I do wish it would stay connected, but definitely not a deal-breaker. Raise the review to five stars, well deserved."

I started writing this review to support three stars, and as I was writing it, it was clear I didn’t even think they deserved three. The reason they’re even getting two stars: the shape and structure are way better than the AirPods at staying in your ear. This is the reason I got them to begin with. I’m stopping the praise there because I don’t think earbuds should be praised for staying in one's ear. The mic in these is also better for phone calls in the outdoors (I’m told by people I’m talking to) as they do better at blocking wind from overtaking the mic and muting your voice. However, the positives end there. The connectivity of these to my iPhone, iPad, or basically any electronic device I’ve used them with is laughably bad. I mean, truly, comically terrible at staying connected to your device while playing your music or podcast or audiobook. I have yet to go a single session without the program I’m listening to cutting out, sounding robotic, or having the two earbuds being out of sync. Yes, I always start by putting the right one in my ear first and waiting for the ding-dong and battery level verification before putting in the left earbud (which, how dumb is that). I still, without fail, have many interruptions through my workout or conversations due to some type of connectivity issue. The sound, if they connect, is what you’d expect from Bose headphones, right up until the point you hear static or out-of-sync earbuds that sound like you're listening to wired headphones with an exposed wire. Lastly, they are huge. The case is huge, and if you have a case protector to protect your $250 pair of earbuds, they are way too big to comfortably keep in your pocket. I have to clip them to my work bag so I don’t have a second bulge sticking out of my pants. I’m super disappointed in these earbuds but am past my return date, so my only choice is to make sure I do my part in preventing someone else from making the same mistake."

My honest take on these is that I'm disappointed. So much hype is out there about how well Bose products cancel out noise. I bought these in hopes that they would make hotel stays with the loud snorer in my life bearable. Unfortunately, not even Bose is a match for this snorer. They do not cancel out the snoring. I've even tried playing Pandora through the earbuds and I can still hear the snoring. Additionally, they don't stay in the ears while sleeping. So, I've resorted to having to wear these with Pandora music playing while also wearing a pair of over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones to try to drown out the noise. I typically do not expect perfection, but again with the hype and the price of these earbuds, I did expect better."

I had the 1st QC earbuds and used them from full charge to battery depletion pretty much every day for over 2 years. One of those earbuds finally stopped working, so I figured I'd give the new ones a go. I've had them for a little over a week now, and they are a downgrade in every single aspect other than their form factor and comfort. Instead of giving you my life story, I'll give you what you want. The connection issues are very real; these things are a nightmare to connect to anything. If you're often swapping devices with them, you're going to have a constant bottleneck in your life, which will be getting these headphones to connect to anything. Then after you've finally gotten both earbuds to connect, they will randomly disconnect, for no apparent reason, from time to time too. One last thing about their connection issues: when I was connected to my PC with my old ones, if I had to go to the opposite side of the house or something - yeah, they'd disconnect, but when I came back to my PC, they'd reconnect seamlessly and it just worked. These not only do not reconnect, they never properly disconnect when out of range so you can't just reconnect them. You have to put them back in the case, mess around with your PC's Bluetooth settings until it says they're disconnected, then you have to go through the tedious process of getting them to connect again. It sucks. Now on to the case, it's trash. Yeah, it's slightly smaller than the other one but it lost wireless charging, doesn't have a latch like the old one, and it is not sturdy at all. It's the case for a $300 pair of earbuds, and you could easily snap the lid off of it while putting it in your pocket because it's so flimsy. The headphones have almost non-existent magnets that hold them in the case, and there is no latch or magnet for the lid at all. Thus, if you drop this case, there is no chance the earbuds will remain in the case. I honestly can't believe Bose released this low-quality product as their flagship earbuds. Sound quality - the same as the old model except if you hear something high-pitched, it will overload the speaker and make a very shrill noise in your ear that hurts. Overall, the sound quality has gotten worse from the last pair. Noise cancellation - is the same as the last pair, if not a little better because the overall shape, design, and fit of the new earbuds are much better than the first model. A niche issue but actually is the dealbreaker for me and is the reason I'm here giving a detailed bad review: there is not anywhere in the settings to turn the touch buttons off on the earbuds. I often go on long runs outside, and once I start sweating, buttons start getting pressed by my sweat. This constantly disrupts my audiobook and my run flow. Now, these headphones are going back, and I'll just buy a new pair of the first model QC earbuds. Another reason I made sure I came and left a truthful review is because of the price point and brand of these earbuds. When you buy Bose, you expect top-quality, premium, dependable products. This is not that."

While my fingernails aren’t long, I couldn’t grab. I have a couple broken nails on my right hand, and it was still difficult. I loosened one enough from the case to get it, but it’s also slippery and landed in the corner of my couch. I was able to grab it before it fell to the bottom, but please beware.

The noise canceling is great, but its biggest weakness is wind. If you are trying to use it outside, you will hear the wind if there is anything stronger than a breeze (even at its highest noise canceling setting). Because of that, it works great indoors, but is less than ideal outdoors. I have also had issues occur where both the earbuds would connect, but only one will play audio. For me, it's usually the right bud that connects but doesn't play audio. When this happens, the right bud can still be used to pause and skip, but no sound comes out. Additionally, noise canceling does not work when this occurs since both buds need to output audio. Meaning that this not uncommon problem takes away the biggest selling point of these earbuds. The easiest solution I've found to this is to place the buds in the case and charge the case (just placing the buds in and closing the case has not consistently worked). While this is an easy enough fix, it is not a problem I expected to have at this price point. Furthermore, if you are on the go, you may not have a charger on you and will have to wait for access to it."

I am a grown woman with ears the size of a five-year-old. Most earbuds are too big, hurt my ears, and pop out when I move my jaw (in other words, that means singing is out of the question). I did a lot of research, reading as many articles as I could on this very specific subject. I decided to go for broke and try these first. When I first pulled them out of their case, I was skeptical of the size. I was sure I was going to pop them out of my ears, as usual, and they'd break on the floor. So I sat in the middle of my bed, followed the instructions to the letter, and gave them a shot. First, I moved my jaw aggressively in every possible direction. They stayed put. Then I jerked my head from side to side, and they remained in place. Then I got up and jumped on the bed, and they never budged. Only then did I decide to try them out around the house. I've had them for a couple of months now and have had zero issues with them. They are comfortable and stay in place. Just be sure to follow the instructions to put them in properly. And, yes, the sound quality is phenomenal - as to be expected from Bose. Thank you for making earbuds that are comfortable and stay put in my tiny ears!"

I had been in the market for active noise-canceling wireless Bluetooth earbuds, and had considered many brands. I ultimately went with Bose due to their recognized reputation. While I am overall happy with them, there are some negatives I'd like to share. First, they are a bit difficult to remove from the charging case. I have taken to flicking them to get them to come out. Similarly, I use them to watch movies occasionally while in bed. They are a bit difficult to seat properly in the case without shining a light on them - kind of undermines my reason for using them to watch something to subsequently fall asleep to. The lack of Qi or wireless charging is also a bit of a detraction. For earbuds in this price range, that should be a standard in this day and age. I sought out active noise cancellation as I travel frequently. I have not yet had the opportunity to try the active cancellation on a plane as of yet. The app or software that governs the modes and whatnot should, in my humble opinion, have more than the currently 4 preset noise cancellation modes, and, though it may be available, I haven't found it yet, the software/app for a laptop or desktop. Overall, they aren't bad, with the additions of the items mentioned above though, they could become exceptional."

The only redeeming quality of these has been the sound and ANC quality. Everything else has been pretty abysmal at best. When taking phone and Zoom calls, I was told I sounded like I was underwater because the microphone was so poor. So if you are planning on using these with a lot of calls, I suggest you look elsewhere. Additionally, the carrying case for the headphones is extremely cheap and flimsy. I imagine the flip lid will become a point of failure rather quickly with any amount of normal use. It's already got a good bit of side-to-side play when closed, and I've barely had these for a couple of weeks. To top it all off, I am now getting connection issues to all of my devices that seem to be completely unresolved even after removing, resetting, and re-initiating connection to my phone and the Bose application. Overall a terrible experience with these Bose headphones, which is disappointing from a company who is supposed to be an industry leader. If I'm able to return these, I will definitely be looking elsewhere. Perhaps I should've listened to the online reviews that said Sony was the way to go for quality at this price point, because Bose certainly hasn't delivered with these."

Software and connectivity are flaky and outdated. Good: Excellent noise cancellation. Completely blocks fan hum noise, most of TV sound, and conversations. Taking out one earbud pauses media play and disables noise cancellation. Once re-inserted, the media starts playing and noise cancellation activates. This is very helpful when you need to talk to someone briefly. Comparison: Bose QuietComfort 2 95% noise reduction, Samsung Buds 2 40%, Jabra Evolve 75 30%. I can wear the Bose QC 2 for >2 hours easily and sleep with them. They don't fall out. Samsung Buds 2 get loose and easily fall out after moving my jaw too much. Ridiculous. I can't wear any over-the-ear headset comfortably for more than 20 minutes. Bad: In-ear detection is problematic. I finally learned that when inserting, I have to firmly press and hold the bud into the ear for 2 seconds before letting go for the ear detection to work. Once the bud activates in the ear, there are no further issues. Before I learned how to do that, I resorted to a complete reset, which requires many steps and time. No tracking for the buds or the case. No indication of how much charge the case has. Cannot automatically switch between two devices. Manual switch is problematic. It may require shutting off the Bluetooth on the device you are trying to disconnect from. No wireless charging. Really? It is 2023. Occasionally, the app can take 10 seconds to connect. I had to exchange the original order because the buds could no longer connect to the phone app. Good thing it is simple to replace with Amazon if the problem happens early on. Bose must improve its software and quality control. You may feel slight ear pressure from noise cancellation. Mind you that earplugs are 10 times more uncomfortable. People with very good hearing may hear slight white background noise when surroundings are completely quiet. This doesn't seem to bother anyone much. The price is steep, but if you pay half as much, you will get a quarter of the noise cancellation quality. There is much to improve. Would I buy it again? With such connectivity and app issues, I am not sure anymore."

Speaker lover here. I recently bought these a week ago and received them recently. I tested them out. If you bought these because of bass and you love bass, the bass selections that are already on the app don’t work at all and only add just about 5 percent extra bass if you chose one. You’d have to play with the EQ in order to get the bass to work. Since I love speakers a lot and find them fun to use and enjoy the bass part. I’ve messed with the EQ on my phone and got the bass where it’s strong and sounds good but also to where you can still hear it. I also found out that clear to the right on EQ, if you wanted to hear more of the voice, then move the label 4k up higher. It will decrease the bass by a small percentage but still give you that advantage to listen to the bass and still hear the voice louder. Lowering the 4k will add more bass and lower the voice. I’ve provided screenshots of what my configurations are on the EQ and what my general settings are for these earbuds from JBL. My final review is the color is cool, the case is well durable, the earbuds themselves are comfortable in your ears, they work well and have a high volume sound. They last a good amount of hours as well which is a big + for me. I did notice someone had posted a review regarding the EQ, I’ve used their EQ style and it flattens the bass and does not give you the bass you want. Otherwise, hopefully this EQ I set up works for others!"

This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds. I'm an audio engineer, so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal. However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just okay or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent. Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end Bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a Bluetooth headset for my phone. After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beams as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely to deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products. In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high-frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned. When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams, I understood what people were talking about. However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears. I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box. If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears, it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable-sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them. Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.) For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds. After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum. I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the bass preset in the JBL app. You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB. I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work. I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you. I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams. I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions. However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself. I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit). As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen). What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves. During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume). Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better overall and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies. And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode. The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene. However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you. As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds. The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see. I wish JBL had made the 'L/R' letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see. The pairing process was fairly easy with all my Bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source. There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods at the same time as I was using the JBL's. I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these Bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones."

I had to replace a set of headphones that stopped working. So this time I thought I would try a set of earbuds instead. I know JBL usually has good products, price was decent, so I thought I would try these. First, I will say the sound and volume are pretty good. If you are using these on your phone, the JBL app also makes a big difference with the equalizer and the other hear-through type features if you don't want to block out all noise. I really wish they had a similar app for PC, as I use them on my laptop more than my phone, and it's really when I need to hear people talking, etc. With that said, the fit isn't great. I tried all the different sizes of the rubber covers, but none seem to fit right in my left ear for some reason. I've had it fall out once already when just bending over to pick something up off the floor. They are also difficult to get out of the case; the lid should open further or just have a way to grab a hold of them easier. The battery life is okay, but doesn't seem to be anywhere near the 32 hours listed, including the recharge feature of the case. I've gotten about half that before they kept telling me they were low battery, and I had to charge them and the case both back up. All in all, these may work well for some people. I am thinking about returning them and trying something else though."

As an avid music lover, I'm always on the lookout for earbuds that deliver exceptional sound quality, and these earbuds absolutely deliver. The JBL deep bass sound technology truly lives up to its name, providing rich, immersive audio that brings my music to life. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls on the go, the sound clarity and depth are unparalleled.

I've never experienced any lag or dropouts, even when moving around in busy urban environments. Plus, the water and dust-resistant design give me peace of mind, knowing that my earbuds are protected against the elements during workouts or outdoor adventures. Comfort is also a priority for me when it comes to earbuds, and the JBL Vibe Beam doesn't disappoint. The ergonomic design and multiple ear tip options ensure a secure and comfortable fit, even during extended listening sessions. And with the hassle-free touch controls, I can easily adjust volume, skip tracks, or answer calls with just a tap. Overall, I couldn't be happier with the JBL Vibe Beam true wireless earbuds. They combine top-notch sound quality, reliable connectivity, and comfort in a sleek and durable package.

Excellent Bluetooth earbuds for the price ($39.95 at the time of purchase and review, list price of $49.95) but I would have been just as happy paying the list price had I not purchased these on discount. The sound quality is surprisingly good. The 'JBL headphones' smartphone app is highly recommended as using the app will allow you to switch to and from audio and video mode. Audio mode has better sound quality and video mode syncs the sound to the video. Honestly, I don't really notice enough difference in sound quality between the two modes so I tend to keep it in video mode so I can switch between listening to Pandora or watching YouTube without having to open the app and switch modes. The fit is very comfortable and secure in my ears. I haven't used these for working out yet but I feel like I could go jogging or hit the gym and not have to worry about losing them. I found the default medium-sized cushions to be just right for me, but included in the box are smaller and larger cushions for people with different-sized ears."

I read a lot of these reviews; most are good. Mine is as well. I bought these to replace my Beats. I was very impressed; they are actually better than my $150 Beats were. Sound is amazing; the adjustable equalizer makes getting the perfect sound for your needs easy. They fit in the ear well; they are comfortable and don't fall out like my Beats did. They are a little hard to remove from the case, but that's actually a good thing. I know people complained about that, but it also means they are harder to just fall out. Another complaint was about the case being too slippery and getting scratched up easily. My Beats case was more slippery, and all cases get scratches eventually. So far, I haven't gotten any on these. The battery life is also a huge selling point. I'm not disappointed at all. Very inexpensive with an expensive feel."

Lots of good feature ideas that don't really work in real life. When I purchased these, I didn't know about the touch controls features. So if you touch one of them, it will pause what you are listening to, or if you touch the other, it can adjust the volume depending on where you tap it. It's very sensitive, and I find anything that touches it, like hair or a hat, will pause your podcast. You can turn this feature off with the app. The find my buds feature in the app for this is great in theory, but pretty useless in real-life practice. (I lost one of them a week after owning them.) Unless they are currently on and Bluetooth connected to the phone with the app, you can't make it ping the bud and make a sound to find it. So despite knowing where I lost the bud and knowing I was in range, I couldn't find it. So I now have one earbud. The sound quality is good, but the noise-canceling isn't capable of canceling out a mower or a weed whacker enough for you to hear what you were listening to clearly. The pass-through sound feature isn't really useful either; on this scale, the mic quality just isn't good enough to do that and not have people sound like old robots. It does work; it just makes everything sound like an old mono radio broadcast. The battery life is really the best feature of these buds. I can listen for 5 hours straight and not have to put it back on the charger. I only listen to podcasts on my single remaining earbud; maybe if you listened to something with more bass, it would drain faster. But for my purposes, it's perfect. I also really like that the app shows you the remaining battery percentage of each bud."

There is a slight audio delay between video and audio, and the audio quality is just not that great, but I am assuming that’s Apple’s doing for using a non-Apple product with their phone. I used to use these with a Samsung product and they were awesome, liked them a lot. I mostly plan to use these to just listen to stuff, not really watch and listen, so I'mma keep them because screw Apple. If Google can make YouTube worse on non-Chrome browsers, I'm sure Apple can affect a device by making the quality a bit worse and purposefully putting in a delay. One month use update: my only real complaint is that they are kind of hard to put away quickly. It takes concentration because you have to rotate them before you put them away, and I have fumbled/dropped them fairly regularly when I am trying to put it away in a hurry or without looking at it. It's hard if you’re trying to put them away with anything else in your hands like a pen, book, bag/purse, sunglasses, etc. The charging case could be improved if they made it so that you didn't have to rotate them after you took them out of your ears in order to put them away, and if they made the stems completely rounded so that they rotated smoothly."

I am very impressed with these buds and they've exceeded my expectations by a long shot! I use a Samsung S20+ & bought these off Amazon because I lost my Skullcandy buds I got from Ross and I liked those ones a lot so was looking for something similar in style to replace them. I didn't expect these to exceed my expectations. I was surprised upon downloading the JBL app to find these are 'smart buds' (like Samsung Pods/Apple Pods). I've attached pictures of the cool things you can do with the buds from the app but the biggest/best feature of them all is if I lose them, I can find them with the press of a button from the JBL app. I wish I had that feature when I lost my Skullcandies but idc anymore because these buds are dope, sound amazing and look great! I'd highly recommend."

I work as a service advisor at a large dealership. I use the right earpiece only most of the time so I can clearly hear customers and technicians, but still hear and receive messages and calls. I love how clearly I can hear people on phone calls and how well they can hear me, unless I'm in the back shop with the loud noises from the mechanics (of course). I only get about a half of a workday before I hear the friendly female voice say battery low, and I'm forced to put the right one back in the charging case and switch to the left, which is not preferable as I use my left ear to answer the work phone. My only other negative is that you can't use the find my feature if they're in the case. The other evening as I was emptying my pockets to go to bed, I noticed they were missing. It turns out they fell out of my pocket while at home watching TV, and it took me a while to find them. It would've been nice to be able to find them quicker. On the positive side though, I love the ambient aware feature so I can really have conversations without taking them out. They are comfortable and stay in my ears even on my 7-mile bike ride home after work. The sound quality for videos and music is great, no complaints there. When these die or I lose them, I'll definitely stay with JBL, either these again or I'll see if there's one with a little better battery life. Overall, you can't beat the price for what you get."

I’ve had a couple of different generations of AirPods as well as numerous other brands of wireless earbuds (including JBL Tune, which I wasn’t a huge fan of). I was looking into getting the AirPods Pro again, but decided I just didn’t want to spend that much money. After some research, I ended up choosing JBL Vibe Beam and felt fairly comfortable with my decision because I am a fan of JBL. I do not regret it at all. They are better than AirPods by far - piece of advice, get the “JBL Headphones” app. The earbuds automatically come on the jazz setting so I could see how someone wouldn’t be satisfied. You can change the equalizer (I used one of the top picture reviews and copied how they had theirs, but they also have other presets). I listen to a lot of rap, metal, alternative, etc., so bass is a huge thing for me and using the equalizer was a game-changer. The sound is so clear and the bass is amazing. This is probably the most satisfied I’ve ever been with an earbud purchase. It’s also super easy to connect them. The name showed up right away so the total process maybe took 10-15 seconds to pair them for the first time, which is pretty rare. I’ve had some issues with other earbuds in the past (spending up to 5 minutes trying to pair them)."

They charge quickly, and the light changes colors from orange to green when fully charged, so no guesswork is nice. The tap-to-pause feature is great so you don’t have to pull a bud out when you need a quick chat or listen. Paired instantly with my Apple phone and does the job for substantially cheaper than competing products."

Update: still like these, one downfall - can't be paired to two devices at the same time. They fit really well. I have small ears and these are comfortable. I have other ones by this brand which is not the case. The audio is good. I use them during video conference calls for work and during the day listening to music. Initially, I had trouble pairing them, now they pair very easily but I think that was user error on my part. Only mentioned it because don't give up if you have that same problem... and no, I didn't read the directions lol. They stay put, which is nice. Again, the other two pairs I have from the same brand do not. If you can't tell already, I would highly recommend these. The only thing I don't like about this Bluetooth is the color because I don't like those white things sticking out of my ears. Personal."

I bought these for my ten-year-old son, who wanted his first pair of wireless earbuds but doesn’t have the greatest track record of keeping track of small items. I figured for this price it wouldn’t be an enormous hit if they got lost or weren’t the best audio quality. Shame on me for judging based on price, because these are amazing quality and perfect for what I wanted out of them. They hold a great charge, charge quickly, and sound amazing. They’re easy to pair to any phone and have survived endless drops and scuffs. They also come with three sizes of soft earpieces so you’re sure to find a size that is comfortable for your particular ear. These are great contenders against any bigger name brand alternatives!"

I've paid twice the price before and not been nearly this impressed. They bring a new clarity of sound to some albums in which I have been previously disappointed, e.g., Clockwork Angels, which has always sounded muddy, even on my custom home sound system. My music tastes have a wide range; whether classical, big band jazz, prog rock, shoegazer, etc., these buds really deliver for the price. With the app, there is good ability to adjust the sound and other settings, which is very nice, if not unique to JBL. However, there is one big caveat. With all the earbuds I have used over the years, I have never, ever had such a pain-in-the-*$$ time getting these darn things out of their charging case!! They are stupidly hard to grasp-- they sit deep in the case, don't have a good way to grab them, and the lid very much is in the way of trying to get to them. If you buy these, know you have to be very careful and deliberate about removing them from the case or you will definitely drop them and ultimately ruin them. And if you have big fingers, seriously consider another product...unless you just get a kick out of being extremely frustrated. JBL, if you're listening (sorry for the pun), redesign the case so the earbuds rest in them 180 degrees from the way they do now, increase the surface area to pull them out, and please, please, redesign the case to have the lid flip farther back out of the way so that people with even average-sized fingers can get to these earbuds!"

I can use them all day without any ear discomfort. They have seriously fallen out of my ear maybe a total of 3 times since I've owned them, and that's everything from jumping off trailers to jumping on shovels. These things have started in no problem! The sound is pretty great if you ask me. I've also never bought any high-end earbuds or headphones to compare to, and the same goes for any ANC or fancy features of those sorts. I can tell you they work pretty well from the knowledge I know and the use I have with them! I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for a quality product without spending an arm and a leg.

I counted on Simple Green to get my “business casual” clothes clean enough to be able to go into a facility’s offices to do the calculations, review paperwork, and meet with the facility’s manager to discuss the audit results. I also use it around the house to clean up dirty spots on bathroom and kitchen tiles that have a rough, uneven surface."

Seriously though, if you aren’t already familiar with it then don’t be afraid to try it for yourself. Cleans most things without needing to be made up of overly harsh chemicals. Great for the kitchen and bathroom but also cars and outdoor stuff. All in all it’s the first cleaner I go to when I want something cleaned up. If Simple Green doesn’t take care of it then I move on to the harsher stuff but that usually rarely happens. This pack with the three spray bottles is nice but honestly I just wish they sold it in a gallon jug. Maybe my search skills are subpar but it seemed most different options had a combo of spray bottles and jugs. At the end of the day give Simple Green a try if you want a cleaner that you don’t feel like you’re gonna die using. It works great and is super safe."

The only issue I had was that each of these bottles is a concentrated version, so you need another spray bottle on hand to dilute the concentrate for its other purposes. At its concentrated version, it’s good for super tough jobs, but for cleaning the home or general wipe-ups, it needs to be very diluted. The bonus is you just spray in the amount you need into the new bottle, so it’s easier to mix up with water. But it’s slightly annoying."

I love the delicate verbena scent in Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day multi-surface cleaner. It’s very mild compared to other common household cleaners like Mr. Clean (Mr. Clean is one that knocks me over, and I can’t stand the smell). Many years ago it was fine, but the scent has changed and become stronger, and not for the better. Manufacturers on the whole use way too much scent in their products, whether it’s laundry detergent, fabric softener, hygiene products, and anything else that scent is added to. Just take a walk down the detergent aisle of your grocery store, and if you aren’t immune to scent, you will find it overwhelming. This cleaner is not overpowering and smells just like verbena, a fresh, clean, green smell. I also love the way it cleans my wood floors, sinks, countertops, stainless steel fridge, stove & dishwasher, & everything else I clean with it. It leaves the surfaces “squeaky clean” without any streaks. Is it a good deep cleaning cleaner? I don’t know for sure since I’ve never used it to clean up muddy, greasy, grimy, dirty areas in my home. It does remove dark marks on painted walls, but I haven’t tried it on heavy dirt and grime. I imagine it’s comparable to Murphy's Oil Soap, which is another brand I love and have used for years. If the scent of cleaners is an issue for you, and you like verbena, you should love this cleaner. A little bit goes a long way in a bucket of water (for washing floors, etc.). I usually use a lot less than is recommended (in everything from laundry detergent to household cleaners), especially my laundry detergent. I used to use the recommended amount and found with concentrated products, the amount recommended is way too much. I could feel the soap in my clothing after the wash cycle finished. I had to re-rinse all my loads. Then I got smart and cut way down on detergent and included vinegar in the final rinse cycle. Manufacturers love to sell more product, so don’t go by what they state on the container. Use your own wise judgment. On a side note, I love Costco’s industrial-strength powdered laundry detergent, but I cut way back to 1/4 cup per medium to large loads. The white dress shirts and T-shirts are much brighter & whiter compared with many other detergents I’ve used in the past. I highly recommend this product for all of the above reasons. Give it a try at least once. You may love it too!"

I settled on 2 tsp of Meyer's in my machine with the water level up to the top of the solution line. This worked okay. No streaks but also didn't clean very well.

It strips grease, cleans grime, removes stains, freshens the air, brightens whites, removes mildew and bacteria. 10/10 recommend using this concentrate 1-3-1 ratios: 1 part concentrate 3 parts water 1 part alcohol. This is recommended to let sit for 5 minutes and then wipe away with a water cloth. 100% do not skip this step.

My condo association allows the renting of units, and unfortunately, one of those renters moved in with roaches - and over time - the entire building had to deal with roaches. We pay for exterminators monthly for inside and out - and honestly - if there was an improvement, it wasn't obvious. One day I saw a roach in my kitchen - and those dang things are faster than your hand and manage to scurry away before you can smash them. I spritzed one with my lemon verbena spray - and it was paralyzed. It wasn't killed - but it didn't know what to do. I've since learned that roaches hate verbena the way mosquitoes hate citronella. Verbena and citronella are related - and even have a similar scent. I've conquered the roach issue by spraying all around my kitchen every night before bed (sink, appliances, inside cupboards, countertops - and near wall sockets, which are entry points). I also spray around my bathroom sink and drain, counter, and wall sockets. This habit has been remarkably successful. Next, I will spray a test area of grass outside my condo where neighboring dogs like to relieve themselves to see if it deters dogs while not killing grass (will report back). :)"

A little goes a long way! I've been looking into getting rid of using the harsh chemicals in my life both for myself and the health of my family. The list of possible side effects of the commonly purchased store cleaners continues to grow. I don't want to worry about taking anyone to the ER or calling the CDC for an accident with those products... not to mention, natural cleaners are better for the environment. My usual natural cleaner is white vinegar with a few drops of dish soap. This can be a bit harsh as far as scent. This is still my go-to for heavy cleaning or light disinfecting, but I wanted a more pleasant means of general cleaning. I'm new to the line of Mrs. Meyer's cleaning products. I've recently been using the laundry detergent and decided to try some of their other products. I've tried this cleaner on fresh grease splatters, floors, windows (left no streaks surprisingly), all around my kitchen counter and splashboard... so far those surfaces and jobs were tackled flawlessly. I'm in love with the scent. I can't get enough of it. It's a refreshing clean smell... not lemony though, so don't be fooled by the name of it. Lemon verbena is an herb which is supposed to smell like lemon... although in this cleaner, I don't think so. It's not a floral scent either. It's just very pleasant. For my general cleaning, the ratio I've been using is 32 oz of water to 2 oz of the cleaner. I purchased spray bottles for a couple of dollars and they'll last a couple of years. I bought this from the seller Amazon.com LLC, which I feel is important to list this info. I've come across sellers with variances in their items, including knockoffs, even if listed as the same brand."

If you are living in a roommate situation like I am, cleaning supplies are one of the largest household expenses.

I was buying pre-diluted bottles at Walmart and would go through them in a couple of weeks. I only paid ~14 dollars for this two-pack, and I can honestly tell you that even with all the cleaning I do, this concentrate will last me the rest of the year here. You need only a tiny bit of concentrate in the bottle, it goes a long way! And the smell isn't overpowering. I spent 10x last year on cleaning spray rather than buying these concentrated bottles. 10/10 recommend!"

I never enjoyed cleaning until I started using Mrs. Meyer's. I actually love cleaning, doing dishes, smelling those amazing scents. Not for everyone, I know, so if you’re sensitive to smell, you should probably go the unscented route. They don’t make my head hurt like other cleaners have. I am a former bleach addict; I couldn’t clean anything without it! Now I use this concentrate in my spray bottle, and if I need some deeper cleaning, I add some white vinegar. It makes everything smell amazing! I also use it in my mop bucket with vinegar. It leaves your floors nice and clean with no sticky residue. We have tile and wood, and I usually just damp mop my wood with this solution. I also mix the scents. I just ran out of lavender, which is one of my favorites. The basil is a little strong for my taste, but mixed with something else is more tolerable. They last forever! I use it with a magic eraser on counters and sinks, toilets, mirrors, and everything. Wipe with a microfiber and no spots or residue. Smells great and so do you. Also doesn’t leave your hands all cracked and dry."

They clean very well, and a little goes a long way. I use them for my home and cleaning jobs. I've read some people complain about a strong scent. The scent can be strong, but again you don't need a lot. I'd rather have a strong essential oils smell than chemicals. Occasionally, for a client, I've had to use chemical cleaners and the burning, coughing, and unpleasant smell are not worth it to me. Also, some have said that they don't clean well. I guess that would depend on how dirty something is to start with. The less frequently you clean, the greasier/crustier the object is that you are cleaning, the harder it is to clean with any product. My experience with Mrs. Meyer's cleaning quality is excellent. I use them for dishes, floors, laundry, appliances, vehicles, anything and everything."

I mean, Mr. Clean sounds like the name of a retired pro-wrestler turned cleaning guru, right? But let me tell you, this cleaner is the real deal. It's like hiring a tiny army of cleanliness ninjas to tackle the grime in your home. And don't even get me started on the scent. It's so fresh, it's like your house just took a shower. I catch myself sniffing around like a bloodhound just to get another whiff. Who needs air fresheners when you've got Mr. Clean? But here's the kicker – it's so concentrated, you could probably clean the entire neighborhood with just one bottle. Okay, maybe not the whole neighborhood, but you get the idea. A little goes a long way, which means more bang for your buck and more time for you to do... well, anything else!"

In this review, I'll share my experience with The Pink Stuff and why it has become an indispensable part of my cleaning routine. Powerful cleaning action: The Pink Stuff's cleaning paste boasts an incredible cleaning action that easily removes stubborn stains and grime from bathroom tiles and grouts. I was astonished at how effortlessly it tackled soap scum, water stains, and dirt build-up that had accumulated over time. With just a small amount of the paste and a bit of scrubbing, my tiles and grouts were restored to their original shine and cleanliness. Effective on different surfaces: What impressed me the most about The Pink Stuff is its versatility. It is not only perfect for bathroom tiles and grouts but also works wonders on other surfaces throughout the house. I've used it on sinks, countertops, stovetops, and even outdoor furniture with equally remarkable results. The fact that one product can tackle various cleaning tasks is a huge plus for me. Gentle on surfaces: Despite its powerful cleaning action, The Pink Stuff is surprisingly gentle on surfaces.

It's not overpowering like some other cleaning products, which can be bothersome during cleaning sessions. The subtle scent leaves the bathroom smelling fresh and clean without being too overwhelming. Affordable and long-lasting: A little goes a long way with The Pink Stuff. The small tub of cleaning paste lasts a surprisingly long time, making it an affordable and cost-effective option. It's great to know that I don't have to constantly restock, as a small amount of the paste is enough for thorough cleaning. Conclusion: In conclusion, The Pink Stuff - The Miracle All-Purpose Cleaning Paste has become my go-to cleaning product for effectively and completely cleaning my bathroom tiles and grouts.

Sorry that I didn't take pictures. I was in a huge hurry to get started cleaning when my pink stuff products arrived. Once I started cleaning, I was literally having such a good time that I couldn't stop. The lid on my coffee cup exploded from the pressure and my forgetting to open the vent. Coffee splattered in places I didn't think it could get, including all over me burning me horribly. I had to make a mad dash to urgent care for treatment so the coffee had time to soak into the stucco and dry. I knew I was facing an impossible mission cleaning the walls by the time I got home. I was so badly burned on my chest and neck that I really couldn't clean the mess even when I wanted to. Finally, two weeks later, it was time to get it clean. I dampened the stucco, stepped away from the wall, sprayed twice, and wiped. I had to wait a few minutes and repeat. Voila! Squeaky clean. No hard scrubbing, sweating, or pain! Do yourself a favor and get this stuff. If it can remove coffee stains from stucco, I can't wait to fully recover from my burns to try it on more impossible stains."

Wha…what? Now before you condemn me for purchasing a cleaning product as a woman’s birthday gift, you know at least one crazy person who lives to clean and loves to clean. That person is my sister. We are complete opposites, should you wonder. So, I really gave her an item she loves and will use often. It will save her time and energy, giving her more time to spend at the gym, and time out with ladies who lunch, right? I am such a thoughtful sister. *Bought with love!* Buy it for the clean freak in your circle of people."

That generalized bleach spray did nothing for it, this got it off after one spray and sit. I am no longer annoyed at my tub having a slightly orange tint!
