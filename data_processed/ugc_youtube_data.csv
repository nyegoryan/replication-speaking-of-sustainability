1;"Fragrance";"Lattafa Yara for Women";1;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skQgoAZ8Sg&pp=ygUNTGF0dGFmYSBZYXJhIA%3D%3D";"Hey besties, welcome or welcome back to my channel. My name is Lindsay, and in today's video, we are talking about the Lapa Yara perfume, which is super popular. This is no secret to the internet; everybody and their mother knows about this fragrance. Even my grandmother knows about this fragrance and absolutely loves it. It's very viral; it's very popular here on the internet. So I did want to make my own video on my thoughts, and I also wanted to talk about the flankers. The video is really more about the flankers because I have talked about this perfume on my channel. But if you are interested in me breaking down each and every one, talking about my thoughts and opinions and how they do differ, definitely keep watching. Yara has three flankers: Yara Moi, Yara Tous, and Yara Assad. Now, I don't have a reason because it is said to be more masculine-presenting. It's supposed to be more like a Dior Sauvage kind of dupe or something like that. Based off of Fragrantica, the notes are top notes of black pepper, tobacco, and pineapple; middle notes of patchouli, coffee, and iris; and base notes of vanilla, amber, dry wood, benzoin, and labdanum. And yeah, between that dry wood, patchouli, tobacco, and black pepper, I'm not necessarily sure if I would get down with the fragrance, but I did want to at least mention it in this video in case you're curious. Now, I will be the first one to say that I don't love the packaging on this fragrance. It's not my favorite; it's bulky and I don't love storing it. But I will say it's very, very affordable. I've been loving so much on my Arab perfumes; I've been finding really, really great fragrances So if you do want a video specifically on Lapa fragrances, like all the ones I own, or on my Arab fragrances, my favorites, definitely let me know. They have some killer formulations and for such an affordable price point. I want to say these are under $30. I will go ahead and link that down below, wherever I can find them the most affordable for you. But anyway, starting with Lapa Yara, the original, this is Yara. It's very bubblegummy sweet; it's very pink-like; it's very girly. Oh yeah, when it opens up, it's a little citrusy, and I just cannot emphasize enough how powdery this smell is to me. It's very, very powdery. I want you to know so that way if you do get it and you're like, \"Girl, that's powdery,\" I told you it's very powdery. It's very youthful. It opens up and there is some citrus and a lot of coconut. I get a bunch of coconut, but the way it's mixed in with the other notes is beautiful. So it's not like a suntan-y type of scent because you do have the other tropical fruits. I wouldn't say I get strawberry. Some people say they get a strawberry milkshake. For me, my brain just can't—I just can't go there. I just can't give you strawberry milkshake. But it is really pretty and there is a creamy vanilla that I do get. Maybe I could give you vanilla milkshake, vanilla coconut milkshake, but I can't give you strawberry milkshake. If I close my eyes and think of strawberry, maybe I can see it. It's a pretty blend of a fragrance. It's not groundbreaking; it's not super complex. It's pretty—I don't want to say basic, but it's just a nice girly fragrance. It's just a nice girly, powdery, sweet scent. Beautiful for layering; great for summer because it does have a little bit of a tropical vibe. But overall, I get the creamy vanilla, the powdery quality, and that coconut. Those are the main notes I do pick up on, and as it does dry down on the base, I do completely lose the citrus from the opening. The notes are top notes of orchid, heliotrope, and tangerine. The heliotrope is not like that almondy smell. Middle notes of gourmand accord and tropical fruits, and base notes of vanilla, musk, and sandalwood I would say compared to the other three, she's basic, but like, she's not a bad basic. She's a good basic—a nice essential in your collection. Then we have Yara Tous, which is definitely playing more on the tropical facet of Yara. This is very pretty, perfect for summer. I love the fact that you are getting that Yara DNA. You're getting the coconut; it's still powdery and there is a sweet vanilla. But you're getting more—this is really, really yummy. It's very warm to me. It is super smooth and you do have the musk. It is very much a summer vacation vibe. This is so pretty. And yeah, it's just very feminine as well but more mature. I would say you definitely have something that's not as playful, not as girly. This one is a little bit more grown woman, but not dated, not too mature. This is so beautiful. It's almost a little sexy. I could definitely see myself wearing this on a summer date night or maybe like a summer day date. This is so pretty. It's a beautiful blend of florals and fruits. There's passion fruit, mango—the mango is not super juicy in this scent, but I get it and it's very, very pretty and fun. I love this scent, and again, I find it so just sexy and beautiful and womanly. Like, this is gorgeous. The top notes are mango, coconut, and passion fruit. Middle notes are heliotrope, jasmine, and orange blossom. And base notes are vanilla, cashmere, and musk. Again, this one is super powdery. You do have the musk, you have the really beautiful coconut, but it is a twist that I really do enjoy. Even though it makes sense to me that they are flankers, they smell like their own fragrances to me. That's what I actually really do like about the Yara flankers. So this one is Yara Moi. To my nose, Yara Moi is a more creamy, sweet, cozy type of fragrance. It's really pretty, but I don't know if it's for me. I feel like the combination of the patchouli with this creamy sweetness I'm getting and the peach is just coming off a little bit It definitely is a little off-putting to my nose. It's not even that I hate the patchouli in the fragrance, but I just think the combination altogether—sometimes I smell it and I like it. I think it's cozy, warm, and inviting, and really beautiful and even, yes, a little elevated. But then sometimes I smell it and the notes—I just don't love the way they come together, and that is just the reality. There is a caramel sweetness that you get that is pretty, but overall, I feel like there's a lot more to this one than Yara, but I feel like I get on better with Yara. So I have to say this is my least favorite, but I could see somebody liking it. There is just this creamy sweetness that I really do enjoy, and with the caramel, it's so beautiful and warm. But I think I could have done without the patchouli. Yeah, I just think with the patchouli and the jasmine and the peach, with that creamy milky sweetness, it's just not for me. The notes are top notes of jasmine and peach, middle notes of caramel and amber, and base notes of patchouli and sandalwood. I wish I loved this a little bit more. Sometimes I really enjoy it, but it's just warm and sometimes it can be headache-inducing for me. So they're not my favorite notes blended together. So I hope you guys enjoyed this video. If you did, do not forget to like, comment, subscribe—all the good things. And also let me know down below what is your favorite Yara flanker. Bye besties! I had to re-say besties because my throat, like, cracked and it was very embarrassing."

You guys have already read today's title; you already know I'm going to be sharing my thoughts and opinions on the Yara Lattafa perfume that the girls have been kind of raving about all over TikTok. I might be a little bit late, but in case you guys want to hear how I feel about the Yara Lattafa perfume and if it's worth the hype, definitely keep on watching and stay tuned. Before getting into my review, if you are new here, welcome! My name is Stitchy. Be sure to like this video and subscribe down below as well to become a part of the Stitch gang. Make sure you guys also follow me on Instagram and on TikTok at The Stitch Life A few of you guys might want to know about today's look. I'm actually experimenting with what's going to be my summer makeup look, so definitely stay tuned. My lip combination for today is actually the Rare Beauty lip pencil in the color Strong, in addition to a Pat McGrath lip gloss. I think it's called Whisper Wonder or something like that. I'll leave it linked down below. And my earrings are from a Brooklyn brand, so I'll leave links or something similar down below as well. But yeah, that's the look for today—some light Okay, let's get into what you guys are really here for: my thoughts and opinions on the Yara Lattafa perfume. This is a perfume I actually purchased on Amazon. This is the box that it comes in. It's pretty cute in my opinion—what do you guys think? Nothing too crazy. The bottle is a 3.4-ounce bottle. We know it's an Arabian scent; they're pretty good for giving us nice perfume. So let's get right into it. I'm going to start off with the notes, and then I know a few people have been saying that it's a good dupe for the Burberry Her. I'll get into that as well, but let's start off with the notes for the Yara Lattafa perfume. It says Yara is an exquisite high-end Arabic perfume, awakening your daring senses between tropical aromas, elegant aphrodisiac notes, and as the minutes go by, you will feel sparkling sweet and warm tones with powdery fresh zeal. Top notes include heliotrope, orchid, and tangerine. Middle notes are gourmand accord and tropical fruits. Base notes are vanilla, sandalwood, and musk. The scent type is a musk, and this retails for $32 on Amazon. I want to say I probably paid a little bit less because they were having a sale, but it does retail for roughly $30. Pardon me, this is the bottle. The bottle is stunning. The box is cute, but the bottle is lit. I really, really, really love this bottle. It's very cute in my opinion, and a good size as well. Let's go ahead and spray it. I'm not gonna lie, I've already worn it for probably two full days, and I actually wore it last night as well before I went to bed, and I put it on today as well. But let's give ourselves a couple more spritzes of the Yara Lattafa. I'm not gonna lie, I bought this because y'all said that this was giving strawberry milk and cream That's exactly what I heard it was giving, and I heard it was very similar to the Burberry Her perfume as well. At one point in my life, I did want the Burberry Her, but I have so many fragrances I was just like, \"You know what? You don't need to get this, at least not right now.\" However, I have been looking into the Burberry Her Elixir; I might be picking that up. But let's get into Yara Lattafa. So starting off, I smell pineapple. In one of the descriptions, I didn't read it, but in one of the descriptions, it does say that pineapple is one of the notes. I also get the musk, but I definitely get the strawberry and the cream that you guys are getting as well. It's not listed in the notes on Amazon, but that's what I'm getting—it definitely gives strawberry and cream. I don't know if you guys know that candy that we used to eat when we were younger—nostalgia moment, just a little bit I'll pop a picture up right here. I think it was probably called strawberry cream or something like that. That's what this is, in my opinion, in a bottle. Like, that's exactly what this is. It's definitely sweet, it's definitely fruity, and it's a bit creamy in my opinion as well. It is very nice. So yes, that's what I get from the projection. However, longevity—I'd say this lasts on me for a solid four hours. It's not going to give all-day wear; it's definitely not going to give all-day wear. I definitely feel like it's great to reapply, but it doesn't give all-day wear. And I feel like it's not as strong either. If you get your spritzes in, you could definitely build up the intensity of it in my opinion. But it's not giving—like, something's going on with my light, please—oh, it went away, stop Please disregard But it's not giving like YSL Libre. Nothing like that If you know YSL Libre, then you know. Not saying the fragrance profiles are similar, not saying that at all, but you know how intense YSL Libre is—if you know, you know. It's not giving that, but it is really nice. It is pretty. For the price point, I feel like it is great as well. I could definitely see myself using this on an everyday basis, layering. I've already started to layer this with other things, trust me. Specifically with the Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa I think that's 68, the one that's similar to Baccarat. I also really enjoy pairing it with one of my favorite scents to date because of the powdery note that that scent gives, the Giorgio Armani Si Fiori. Chef's kiss Like, these two together, this and the Si Fiori—immaculate, immaculate, immaculate You can also layer this with some of your musks, being that it does fall in the musk category. I do get the musky vibe that it claims to have, but it's not overly musky. It's more fruity, creamy, milky in my opinion. Definitely getting the strawberry vibes, definitely getting the tropical fruit vibes—that's really what I get whenever I smell this. She's good. And they didn't lie—the minute it starts to dry down even more, you do get the sweetness. It might be giving a little bit of aphrodisiac vibes if they say so, but it smells really good. I highly recommend if you've been thinking about picking this up. Again, it's not going to last all day. Don't expect all-day wear with this $32, roughly $32 fragrance, but it is good. The bottle is also very cute, as I mentioned. It looks nice on my vanity. It's pink, so extra plus if you like pink things. If you like pink things, it's pink. And that kind of inspired today's look. Hold up, let me get a thumbnail. Let me make sure I focus on... Yeah, so onto if it smells like the Burberry Her. I don't have it on me to test, but I will share the notes for the Burberry Her. And I will also note that I worked in Sephora for a couple of years, and I used to sell the hell out of that Burberry Her, so I know what it smells like, okay? I think that's dull enough for me to stand up here and see if it compares or not, but let's get into the notes of the Burberry Her perfume. So the Burberry Her perfume has notes of dark berries, jasmine, musk, and amber. So you already see the berries—strawberry in here, berries in the Burberry Her, and the musk—musk in here, musk in the Burberry Her Its scent type is fruity floral, fragrance family floral. It says it's an artful blend of berries elevated by a spirited jasmine and violet and smoothed out with amber and musk—a multifaceted magnetic fruit gourmand and the scent of freedom. Great! Let me know if you have any text you'd like me to review. Now also, I realized while reading this on Sephora's website, it says, \"Interweaving the house's tailored heritage with unexpected twists and turns, the designer perfume from master perfumer Francis Kurkdjian,\"—hopefully I'm pronouncing this right; if you speak French, please do not kill me—\"opens with an intense burst of berries with blackcurrant, blueberry, and raspberry left to linger in an intense fruity floral sweetness.\" I didn't know Mr. Francis was behind curating Burberry Her. Shoutouts to him He did a pretty good job. I used to sell the hell out of that fragrance. Again, never got it for myself, but I might be picking up the Elixir Real good, it's just even more intense than the Burberry Her, but I definitely think it's a pretty good dupe. It's not a dead-on dupe, it's not a spot-on dupe, but if you want to save a little coin, Amazon got you. Just saying This is good. I like it Spray a little more today. It's good. I feel like the more you spray, the more you will smell it. Keep that in mind But also great for layering If you really wanted to, you can also put on maybe a vanilla perfume oil as your base and then spray this on top to help with longevity. Just giving out some tips But it is very, very good. I'm super happy with my purchase and I recommend, I recommend So, Stitch crew, let me know what you guys think if you own this down below. Comment down below and let me know how you guys are feeling it. If you don't own it, let me know down below if you're going to pick it up. So that pretty much wraps it up.

1;"Fragrance";"Lattafa Yara for Women";3;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kPcypIqlCU&pp=ygUNTGF0dGFmYSBZYXJhIA%3D%3D";"Hello, my lovelies! Welcome back to my channel and welcome to a brand new video. Today, I'm back to talk about some really popular overhyped Arabian fragrances. I have a few in my collection that I purchased myself, and some were gifted to me. I want to go through all of them and give you guys my opinion in terms of quality, the scent bubble, the way that they last, the presentation, and if they are worth your money. Now, keep in mind these are extremely affordable, in my opinion. When we're comparing these to niche fragrances or even designer fragrances, this is a fraction of the cost. Most of these fragrances are all under $50, which is insane to me. I do find a lot of the Arabian fragrances are a dupe for really popular scents. I'm trying to get fragrances that just smell like their own. I'm not really into getting a ton of dupes in my collection because they'll just sit there and collect dust since I already have the original. So, I'm looking for fragrances that have their own uniqueness and personality. Let's go through these fragrances. As always, I will link everything down below. If I have a coupon code, I will link it down below. For all my Canadian girls, these are still available in Canada. You can either get them on Amazon or directly from the website and all that stuff. So, I will link everything down below for you guys. If you're new, please go ahead and subscribe if you haven't already. My name is Karina Waldren. I'd love if you joined our beautiful smell-good family. Let's go ahead and jump right into it. I'm going to go ahead and talk about this one because it's fresh on the market and it's one that I really do feel like you guys need to get, especially for my Gourmand girls. Jump on this right now! This is a CLA from LFA. It's their newest launch and they already have a new fragrance coming out very soon. Again, LFA does not sleep. This one is a Gourmand fragrance. Especially when you just look at the bottle, you can tell that it's dripping in goodness, okay? It's dripping in caramel. It just looks absolutely delicious and you know what? They did not fail with this one. It is a beautiful milky honey-esque Gourmand. I get a lot of the caramel in here. I don't get a ton of the floral notes, honestly. On my skin, it's a lot of the Gourmand notes like the praline, the caramel, the honey comes through in the dry down, the vanilla, the milk. It's not overly lactonic because I will say firsthand, I don't like overly lactonic fragrances So, it's really well balanced with all of the other notes, but it's definitely a dense, heavier Gourmand scent. It's going to be in your face It's going to smell delicious and delectable. This is probably one that I would mainly recommend for the colder months because I do feel like it's a little bit warm, heavy, and dense for a summertime wear. But hey, wear your fragrances the way that you want to. You could always balance it out by layering it, but it is simply delicious. This is for the Gourmand girlies all the way through. It does not smell like a traditional perfume. It smells like a dessert. The talk of the town is that this smells like Bianco Latte and they are extremely similar. Not identical, but very, very, very similar. I did a review over on TikTok and for me, the main difference that I see between this one and Bianco Latte is the texture. Bianco Latte has a more fluffy, whipped, airy quality to it in terms of the texture, while this one is a little bit heavier and denser. So, if you like your heavier Gourmand, you're going to adore this one. But in terms of the DNA, they are pretty close. I would say 95% close. Bianco Latte is slightly more lactonic than this one, I will say, in the dry down. But honestly, for the price point, what are you complaining about? This is beautiful. It's so, so good and it's so Gourmand. They did an incredible job. In terms of sillage, I do get a big sillage in the first hour and then it subsides slightly, but you still will smell this fragrance for a little while. I say overspray it if you love this fragrance to be heavier and really long-lasting. But I do find that the quality is there. It doesn't feel like this is cheap and generic and it disappears Not at all whatsoever It stays on the skin and on the clothes for a couple of hours. Highly recommend for the Gourmand girls You have to love your sweet caramel vanilla fragrance to adore this one because that's what you're going to get. The next fragrance is one that is extremely popular. As soon as I hit TikTok, I saw this all over my For You page. This is a fragrance that everyone talks about. Now, I have the flanked of the original. I do have the original somewhere up there in my collection. I prefer the flanker, so I'm going to pull up this bottle. But let me say that I'm kind of talking about both because they are equally just as popular. This is Kamara Qua from LFA. Again, I have a lot of them from LFA, I'll be quite honest. This one is meant to be inspired by Kilian's Angel Share I will say they are very different. Very, very different I'm just going to say that from the beginning So even if you have Angel's Share, you can still have this in your collection. I don't get a ton of the cinnamon note that I get from Angel's Share, so they do smell different in my opinion. Same kind of vibe, yes You know, they are fragrances that have a similar vibe, but they're not going to smell exactly the same. That's what I think of this one. But when I tell you I love this, I am not joking. It smells so good. This is definitely one for evenings, for colder months. This is so, oh my God, it's intoxicating. It's inviting, sexy, alluring. This is date night vibes right here. It has this sweetness to it that just develops over time on the skin. It makes my mouth water, truly. It does have a boozy vibe to it also, but I get a lot of this sweetness and it's not like a sugar sweet. It's just like a denser, heavier sweetness that just smells luxurious and not cheap. Oh, this one. The bottle The bottle is very high-end. A lot of these bottles, there is so much weight to this bottle. It's not cheap at all. It feels weighted and even the cap is not super lightweight either. It is a glass bottle. I find this one has a little bit more oomph to it. It has a little bit more complexity, more character, and that's why I love this one a lot more. I believe there is also a coffee note in here that is just delectable. It's not too overwhelming, but it's there. Oh, this This is gorgeous and this is very much unisex. You and your man can absolutely wear this fragrance and it's going to smell just as good on him. It's going to smell very luxurious on a man also. Super affordable I get why this is very hyped up. This one should be hyped up because it is definitely great, great quality. It lasts really well on the skin and there is a sillage to this fragrance. The more that I have it, the better the juice has gotten. It's gotten deeper and the performance has gotten even better. 10 out of 10 Now, I'm going to be saying that this is probably my least favorite out of the entire bunch that I'm going to talk about and I don't necessarily feel like you absolutely need it. In all honesty, I don't find, I don't understand the hype. This is Haiti Gold Elixir from LFA. Again, the bottle is actually really nice. I love, love the bottle and I think, again, quality is there. I cannot complain about the quality. Now, in terms of the popularity, the hype, the craziness that people went through to get this bottle in their hand, I really don't understand it because my expectations were so high, especially by the way it was described like the most sexiest, gorgeous fragrance. Then, when I smelled this one, I'm actually going to spray it on paper, I really didn't get much from this fragrance. I thought that it was quite simple, nothing special, nothing stood out to me. So, I pretty much have not worn this scent ever since I picked it up. It slightly did remind me of YSL Libre Intense Yeah, it reminded me of YSL. It's fresh and kind of like citrusy in the opening and floral also and musky. It has like this white musk kind of quality Now, it's not a bad fragrance, okay? I'm smelling it right now. It's not a bad fragrance. It is a really nice wearable scent, especially if you like that fresh mood, uplifting kind of citrusy tone in your fragrances and going in the direction of Libre. You will actually like the scent. I just don't think that it's that special. I don't understand the hype. I don't get it Like, it smells good, but I think I'm comparing it to a lot of the fragrances in my collection and also because the hype was so real, like people were going crazy over this fragrance, my expectations were really, really high and I kind of got let down because this just smells like a really great fresh citrusy vanilla floral fragrance. It's not mind-blowing. There's nothing really unique about this one and again, I find that it's a slight dupe for YSL Libre. Like, Libre is nice, but it's definitely a little different. It's not identical at all. It just kind of has that vibe. But for me, this was just an okay fragrance. Now, for the price point, I'm going to say it's worth it. I'm going to say that it's absolutely worth it because it still smells great. Not the most long-lasting, but you can always overspray, especially when you're paying under $50. I mean, you can go ahead and do a couple of sprays to make this scent last, okay? But for me, this was just an okay fragrance. The next one that I have is one that I fell in love with as soon as I smelled it. Now, I haven't talked about it here on my YouTube channel, but I have talked about it over TikTok and on Instagram. I do a lot of short form content over there, so if you're not following me there, go ahead and follow me. I do a lot of fragrance, hygiene, smell-good content, not just perfume, but we're talking shower routines, hygiene products for women and all of that good stuff. I share a lot of tips and tricks over there, so please don't miss out. It's really like I'm having fun with Instagram and TikTok a whole lot, so follow over there and the family over there is growing quite rapidly. Now, this one is from Cadash and it's called NOA. This fragrance is the epitome of a feminine scent. It smells so good. It smells like a woman, honestly. It's very suave and light and gentle, coconutty floral. It has a bit of this silky, powdery dry down. Oh my God, like I really, really like this one a lot. I'm definitely into very much feminine fragrances and so when this landed in my collection, I just loved it. Oh my God, as soon as you spray this, it just makes you close your eyes and just like relax. It's a very suave, relaxing scent, super gentle, okay? Like it's not doing too much. Oh my God, I get this creaminess and silkiness from this fragrance. Oh, the note breakdown of this fragrance is super appealing and there's a ton of notes that I absolutely love in my fragrances. I'm here on Fragrantica. There's coconut, there's apple, heliotrope, jasmine, rose, there's vanilla, sandalwood, cashmere on Like, that is a perfect combination of such a suave, delicate fragrance. It smells so heavenly, so angelic, and so feminine. So please do not sleep on this fragrance. It is so beautiful, appropriate as a signature scent and even for a bride if you're getting married, honey, this fragrance is stunning. Next fragrance is also one that I've already talked about over on my TikTok and Instagram. It is such a beautiful fragrance because it's in collaboration with Quinton Beach. If you know anything about fragrances, he is a master perfumer that has created some of the most iconic fragrances out there. Like, he literally creates beautiful, wearable fragrances that are just perfection and he did collaborate with LFA to create Tedak. I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, but this one is another stunner for me. I love this one. It is a Gourmand leaning fragrance, but it doesn't smell overly Gourmand. It still smells like a fragrance, which I really enjoy. I haven't worn it too often, I will be completely honest, and the reason for that is, guys, I really just need to declutter my collection. I have too many fragrances. It's becoming overwhelming and a lot of the ones that I love are just not getting the love that they should because I'm bombarded with so many fragrances. So, I will be doing a huge declutter very soon just to kind of make my collection more enjoyable, okay? So, this one here is, like I said, more Gourmand leaning but not overly Gourmand. It's still very wearable. You still get some of the fruity and floral nuances in this fragrance. Now, let me go ahead and spray this on paper real quick and give you guys a gist of this one. I have reviewed it again over on my Instagram and TikTok. As soon as this became available, I purchased it. Purchased it myself with my own money Like I said, there's a mix of gifting and purchased products. Okay, this one's good. This one is good. There are a lot of notes in here. There's like the caramel, there's almond in here, there's rose, there's jasmine, there's of course vanilla I believe there's cashmere on in here and suede. There's honey in here too. So, when you first spray this fragrance, it does smell quite fresh. I don't get a ton of the heavier notes like the caramel I get a lot of the fresh floral notes There's pink pepper in here also, but as it dries down, you're going to get that caramelly vibe, which gives it that gourmand-esque, you know, to this fragrance. I think there is leather, but I don't get a ton of the leather on my skin from what I remember. It just smells good. It smells like a really wearable fragrance. It smells easy to wear, like you can wear this as a signature scent. You can wear this to an occasion at nighttime. You can definitely wear this as a date night fragrance, especially as it develops. You know what? I'm going to spray it here on my skin just to get a little bit more of that scent with my skin. Yeah, the opening, I do get some freshness, some brightness, but a little bit of the spiciness. I think it's from the pink pepper that's in here. Now I'm getting that honey and the honey is just creamy and luscious. It's not overly done because I don't like fragrances that are very honey-leaning. I find they make me a little bit nauseous, but this one, it's just adding that creamy texture to this fragrance, especially with the caramel. There's slightly a bit of this smokiness also in the dry down, but in the best way possible. I believe I'm getting that from the leather note in here, but it just adds so much complexity to the fragrance. This, to me, definitely develops more like a niche fragrance. It's not like you spray it, that's the initial spray and it's going to stay like that. I find it does develop over time. So, you have to spray it on your skin, let it sit, and see how it develops throughout the entire wear. So, this is definitely on the niche quality for me. The performance is great. It lasts really well on me. Honestly, the majority of these ones last really well on me. Oh, it smells good. It smells good. I love the mix of the sweetness with like this smoky, deeper tone of the fragrance It's done really, really well. It does smell a little sexy to me and quite grown. So, for the bottle, for the price point, again, I'm going to say this is worth it. I just get blown away by the fact that these are so affordable. These are not going to cost you $150, $200, $300, $400, $500. These are really, really great price points and the bottle is just done so beautifully. Sometimes I get speechless. The next fragrance that I'm going to talk about is actually not a traditional fragrance. This is a perfume oil. This had people going crazy, okay? This had people going absolutely insane. It was so viral that dupes were coming out of something so affordable. Dupes were coming out. It was so viral that people were trying to resell it for way more expensive than it really is. This one was gifted to me by the brand, by the way, guys. So, I know it is authentic. You really want to be careful when you are purchasing this particular fragrance oil online, especially on Amazon. So, this is another product from Cadl. I believe this is called Hadim Alan. I'm definitely butchering that, but this is the fragrance oil that went super duper viral. This bottle is absolutely insane. There's a lot going on here, okay? There is a lot going on. Now, when I saw the hype, I was like, is this really going to be good? Because I have purchased some stuff off of hype on TikTok that have been a fail for me. But I went ahead and tried this one out. The brand reached out and sent it to me and I got the authentic one, which was great because I really didn't want to buy it on Amazon and get the fake one. This one over here, what I will say about this one, it's probably the most potent fragrance oil I've ever come across. Excuse if my voice was really weird in the last clip. I just realized that my mic was on the floor instead of being right beside me, but it's back now. This one is very much a loud fragrance oil. You can really smell this one. A little goes a long way You just rub it on your skin and there is quite a big scent bubble, which was really surprising. Some fragrance oils just kind of stick closer to the skin and you layer with perfume. You can pretty much wear this one on its own. Now, what does this smell like? Because the way that people hyped this up and all of the descriptions were a little all over the place. So, when you open it up, you have this little thing. I just rub it on the skin and that is exactly how I put it on and kind of rub it in. This, to me, smells very fruity, very tropical, very juicy, and a little bit of this kind of musky, kind of woody dry down. That's ultimately what I get from this oil. Do I think it's worth the hype? To be completely honest, I do find that it's a good oil, but I don't find that it is blowing me away, to be really honest. I like it I think it smells great. I like that I have it in my collection and I can layer it with other fragrances, especially now this time of the year with that tropical note in here. I believe there's like peach and pineapple, but I don't think you need to go crazy to find this one and add it to your collection. I'm going to be really honest. Now, if you're a girl that loves your tropical fruity scents, you're going to absolutely love this scent for sure, especially if you're into pineapple and peach, really juicy tropical notes. But I will remind you that in the dry down, it's a lot more suave. You get a bit of this like almost musky dry down, honestly. But I like it. I haven't worn it out of the house, to be completely honest. It's kind of like has been tucked away in my collection. So, I would say if you can get it, get it, try it out because, again, really, really affordable. But I wouldn't say run, don't walk, as the Gen Zs would like to refer to We have the Yada Sisters. Now, I know that there is a black one that's supposed to go with this collection. I don't have it. I just have these three. These are very, very hyped, like extremely hyped, okay? Everybody talks about this, especially the original Yada, which is the pink one. Let's go through these. Again, I've already reviewed, I've had them for a little bit, and I reviewed them over on TikTok and Instagram. Now, the original Yada, some people were mentioning that this is like a dupe for Delina from Parfums de Marly. Absolutely not Absolutely not Okay? This is a whole other fragrance on its own. I even give it more on the vibe of Burberry Her Elixir It has that almost strawberry-esque, creamy vibe, but Delina? I don't get that. I do not get what people are talking about. It doesn't smell like Delina at all. Now, I will say that it's a nice fragrance. It's very fluffy. It's very feminine, but it's not my favorite from the three whatsoever. I don't find that it is anything too special, but it smells ultra-feminine. So, if you like that, if you like something a little bit softer, slightly powdery also, it's really beautiful. It's a beautiful fragrance. To me, again, I get more of Burberry Her Elixir in this fragrance as opposed to Delina. Delina has that sharpness. Delina has that tartness, and I don't get this at all from this fragrance. I get more of like this creaminess, this fluffiness, sweetness So, it is a really nice fragrance. It's very fluffy. It's very feminine, but it's nothing that I go crazy for. The next one is Yada Moy, and I really like the packaging in the white version. Honestly, it looks a little bit more elegant, but they're all very good weighted, so good quality. Even though they are plastic, I do find that they are really, really good quality. Now, this version is supposed to be more white florals. It's supposed to be a little bit more woody. It has some patchouli in here. It has some sandalwood also in here. Now, when I smell this one, I definitely get a lot more of the white floral. Yeah, I really, really like this one. It smells a little bit more refined, a little bit more sophisticated. It smells like something that you would find at Sephora, to be honest, especially with the designer fragrances. It smells quite crowd-pleasing, in my opinion. If you love white floral fragrances, you will really, really enjoy this one. To me, this is a really nice, elegant, affordable fragrance, honestly. Like, it's done really right. I do get some of that patchouli in here. It's not too heavy. It kind of reminds me of.. Like, what does this remind me of? It's going in the realm of Miss Dior, but it's not like, you know, it doesn't have that super rosy tone that Miss Dior has, but it kind of reminds me of those types of fragrance DNA. Very classic and very wearable and crowd-pleasing. That's what I get from this fragrance. It's nothing too overwhelming, too unbearable, and it just smells like something that I would buy and wear willingly. So, this is one that isn't unique, it's not something that's going to blow your mind, but it is a really, really nice, elegant fragrance. So, highly, highly recommend this one. Last but not least, this is Yada Toys. I think \"Toes,\" I don't even know how to pronounce it, but I will link everything down below. From the look of this bottle, you know that this is going to be a lot more fun. It's very tropical, bubbly. It has a lot of gorgeous fruits in here. Okay, there is, of course, mango, there's passion fruit, there's coconut. It's very juicy. It's very modern and perfect for a vacation. Okay, you've got a tropical vacation coming up. This is the fragrance that you want in your collection, especially for the affordability. It is insane. I do really like this one. You still will get some of the white florals in here like the jasmine and orange blossom, and the vanilla, of course, is in here. Oh, yeah, this is the kind of fragrance that just uplifts your mood. It makes you happy, put a smile on your face because it just smells good. It smells fine. It smells refreshing, juicy. It makes your mouth water. I definitely get a lot of that mango It's juicy and it's just wow. This one is good. This one is good. Again, it's one that you would probably find in a niche kind of brand because I don't find a lot of designer houses do very tropical fragrances. I do not find that I see a lot of like the florals That's what I see, the fruity florals, but not very like mango and passion fruit and coconut, like those really juicy ones. You might get that from like a Floral Street or an Ellis Brooklyn or even Fleur, but not like your YSLs or your Armani. I don't feel like they do fragrances like this. This is really nice. Oh, man, I get more of the coconut in the dry down. It's borderline kind of like a suntan lotiony fragrance with like a very juicy tropical fragrance, like if they combined together, that is what you get from this one. And you can definitely overspray this one. I don't find it to be super duper long-lasting and it's not like heavily beast mode, but the longevity and also the performance is really good. Like, for the price point, it's really good. It's not weak at all, but it's not beast mode, if that makes any sense. So, definitely you can overspray this one. It's going to last you quite a few hours. I would say about five hours and you could top it up after that if you really need to. But honestly, if you're going on a vacation or if you just like a tropical scent, especially for the summertime, this, this is absolutely gorgeous. Like, I can see myself in a really nice outfit by the beach, you know, skin is glistening, you got some body glow going on Oh my God, this is, this is, this is it. This is it. So, out of the two, I like these two. If I were to pick only one, I would go with this one. I really, really like this one. This is a little bit more sophisticated. I have scents that kind of give me this vibe and I think that's why I don't have a ton of tropical fragrances, so that's why I prefer this one. So, those are the main fragrances that are super duper hyped up that I wanted to give you guys my opinion on and let you know if I think it's worth the price point. Honestly, the way that they are priced, absolutely, the price point is not in question here. It's more so how do they perform, what do they smell like So, I hope this video was helpful, but I do want to talk about one little fragrance here that is brand new. It's brand new and this is from the brand Sillage again. It's called Secret Musk As soon as I sprayed this one, I knew immediately what it was supposed to smell like. First of all, let's talk about this packaging because wow, wow, wow. Does that not look beautiful? The packaging is always on point. They're never giving you minimalist packaging. They're giving you over the top. They're giving you sophistication. They're giving you money. Okay, this looks so beautiful. I really like the bottle. Now, the perfume, it comes in a really nice soft solid box right over here, which is insane. I will link this one down below. It's a new one. Like I said, this is a spot-on dupe for Arabian Tonka from Montale. Spot-on dupe I have been wanting to add that one to my collection, but I've kind of been like, spot-on dupe, spot-on dupe, honey, and this is really affordable. Like I said, I'm not into a lot of dupes, but when a good one comes out, honey, I will gladly take it. And this is good. Intoxicating, sexy, money It's getting expensive. It's giving luxury It is so addictive. If you have sampled Arabian Tonka and you just don't want to buy a full-size bottle but you want the scent at an affordable price point, I'm not kidding you, like don't even think about it Right here This is definitely a scent that I will be wearing in the evening mainly. I do find it very intoxicating, very alluring, and like dark and a little mysterious. My husband is also going to wear this because this is perfectly unisex. It's confident. It's a confident scent. It's not one that you just grab and you go to Walmart. No, you get dressed, you do your makeup, you're going out to a fancy restaurant, maybe you're going to an event. This is something that you would wear because it is quite memorable. Oh, I'm so excited to have this one in my collection. I will be linking all the products down below. If I think of any other fragrances that I absolutely think you guys should check out, I will link it down below and I could do a part two. I am getting into more Arabian fragrances. I've added quite a few to my collection. These are just the most viral ones and I wanted to kind of plug this one in because I know my ladies are going to love this one and the fellas too. But yeah, please, please, please, please leave your comments down below. I'd love to see what you want to see next on the channel.

1;"Fragrance";"Lattafa Yara for Women";4;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcbg4cwByLI&pp=ygUkTGF0dGFmYSBZYXJhIGZvciBXb21lbiBFYXUgZGUgUGFyZnVt";"Hey YouTube, welcome back to my channel. Thank you so much for joining me for today's video. In today's video, we're going to be reviewing the newest Lattafa Yara flanker, Yara Twos. So if you're interested in seeing what my thoughts are, then keep on watching. If you are new to my channel, welcome. My name is Oshimari. On this channel, I talk about all things smell goods. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, then don't forget to subscribe to my channel before you leave today, as well as give this video a thumbs up. And if you are a returning viewer, hey, it is so good to see you. Alright y'all, so I hope everybody is doing good. So let's jump right into this battle This is what the newest flanker looks like. It is so bright and just, it looks like the sun and the sunshine. But in comparison to the other colors, I think that, you know, they definitely know what they're doing and the timing of when they're releasing fragrances. So this is what the atomizer looks like. So it's very quick, it's wide So in that opening, you definitely get blasted with a whole bunch of different fruits It's very fruity, very juicy, and you immediately get hit with that mango and the passion fruit that's in the top of this. I was kind of hoping to have more coconut in the opening. I do get a little bit, but you mostly get that coconut in the dry down. As the fragrance starts to dry down, you definitely do start picking up on those floral notes that are in the middle. So in the mid, you have orange blossom, you also have some heliotrope, and you also have jasmine. And then in the base, that's when you have some cashmeran, you have some musk, and then you have vanilla. So I've had this fragrance for about a week and a half, two weeks now. Right when I saw that they were talking about it on TikTok, y'all, TikTok got me again. And ever since then, I've been able to play with it. And I will say that that fruitiness and that tropicalness in here never really does go away. All throughout the fragrance, you're still getting a huge blast of that passion fruit mixed with the orange blossom. So you get fruits and florals, and then you also are getting a lot of that mango. And it's not like a juicy, ripe, real mango. It's kind of like an artificial type of mango. But I feel like the artificial mangoes kind of smell just a little bit juicier. But then as you wear it, it turns more so into this creamy kind of mango-vanilla-coconut mix, and that to me is so, so refreshing. So I am really enjoying this fragrance. Now, this one, in comparison to the last flanker that came out, Yara Moi, I would definitely say that there are some similarities. But this one is much juicier and fruitier. So Yara Moi is like a mix of these tropical woody florals. It's very spicy and it's also got this slight type of graininess to it that's like, I don't know, almost like grassy and earthy. And that grain pepperiness in here really does last throughout the entirety of the fragrance. And that is not going to be for everyone. So I think that could have maybe thrown people off with the last flanker. But I feel like what they did with Yara Twos is they took out the peppery note in here, they tapered down on those florals, they amped up more fruity notes, and that's kind of what you have here. So two different fragrances, but there are some similarities in here, y'all. You will smell them if you have both of them. Which one do I prefer out of the two? It would definitely be Yara Twos. Now, in comparison to the original Yara, I would say that these two are nothing alike. This one's like this strawberry creamy, almost like milkshake, that is so pretty And whereas there are some florals in here, there's also gourmand accords, which I think that's where that strawberry is coming from. So having all three of the flankers, I would say that Yara is like this gourmand creamy strawberry one. So this one's like a gourmand one, this is like a spicy floral, and then this is a tropical juicy fruity take. So out of all the three, would I say that this one is my favorite for right now? Maybe yes, but overall, no. I would definitely say that Yara, the original one, is still my favorite. But I definitely really do like this one and I've been pulling for this one and I've been wearing this one a lot. And y'all, the original Yara also lasts much longer than this one. Not much longer, but I would say this one's good for about six hours on my skin. This one becomes a skin scent very quickly, like maybe after three to four hours. You still get whiffs of it, but it's definitely not as long-lasting as this one. So what I decided to do was I layered these two together. And y'all, when I tell you, if you have both of these, try that because it is so, so good. I'm about to do it right now. So what I do is I put down Yara, the original one, down first, right? And then I go on top of it with the newest one, Yara Twos. And y'all, oh y'all, these layered together is like this tropical creamy fruity gourmand that is perfect for the summertime. It is so addictive. So when I wore this one by itself, I didn't get a compliment from my husband. When I layered these two together, when I walked past him, I saw him go like this. And y'all know that's also another way to see if somebody actually likes your scent trail. If they don't look up, then it's like, okay. But if they look up and they're like, wait, what was that? That's how you know it smells good. And y'all, even if he didn't look up, I knew that I was onto something here. It's such a nice combination. Y'all, just think of all the notes that are in both of these combined. This is literally like a strawberry mango passion fruit daiquiri. You're walking around smelling like all of that on your skin Before I did this combination, I was ready to tell y'all, yeah, this is cute, it's good, it's great for right now, very refreshing. But because of this combination, I would say that you need both of these. This one definitely gives you all those creamy vibes, if that's what you're going for. But if you're looking for that tropical take on a gourmand, then these two paired together are beautiful and they are so addictive, and I can't stop combining these. Overall, I would say that this is a nice flanker, but I do think that you have to appreciate it for what it is. It's not gonna blow your socks off or be like anything that you've never smelled before, especially if you have other mango passion fruit tropical fragrances. But I do think that it is a really good addition to all the other Yaras It definitely does bring you a different take on the original and the Yara Moi. Now also, girl, if you're looking to bring out more of the coconut in here, because I feel like when we heard about this fragrance, we were thinking, oh, mango, passion fruit, and coconut, right? So I thought that all those notes were going to be really prominent. But the fact that the coconut is not as loud as I wanted it to be, that was a bit disappointing. So what you can do is just layer this with a coconut body spray. So the two that I have in front of me are Coconut Pineapple from Bath and Body Works. And this one has notes of shaved coconut, fresh pineapple, and sugar cane. So this is a great combination. And so far, my favorite combination with this one is one that I think is discontinued, but you can still get it on sites like Mercari and eBay, and this is Coconut Palm. This one is such a nice combination. So if you have this, pull it on out. The notes are not listed on the back of this one, but this one is like a very creamy palm mix of coconut and I believe there's some sea notes in here as well. But it's a very milky, creamy coconut, which kind of will also add to the creamy aspect in here. So I would definitely suggest this combination if you have these two But honestly, any coconut prominent body mist that you have will be a great addition to Yara Twos. Alright you guys, that is it for today's review of the Yara Twos. I hope that you guys found this video helpful if you haven't been able to make up your mind on it. If you did like today's video, don't forget to give it a thumbs up before you leave and subscribe to my channel if you're not subscribed. And as usual, take care of yourself, God bless you all, and I will see you on the next one. Bye."

So today, we're doing another perfume review. This time it is Versace Bright Crystal. I love this fragrance, and I finally purchased it. I got this on a Black Friday sale for $99, and it's the big, big bottle. So it's the 3.0 fluid ounces. It's normally, I think, around $140. So I got it on sale for $99. So hopefully, you guys can catch that same sale this coming Christmas as we get closer to the holidays. But let me just tell you what else I got. Macy's was running a special Black Friday sale where if you buy the big bottle, you get a nice little free gift. Let me show you what that free gift is. Hold on This is a whole Versace bag here. Do you see this? Can you see it up close? I want you to get in on that. It's Versace. So, a whole bag if you buy the perfume. So I thought that was pretty nice, so I was really excited. Also, for men's Versace Eros, if you purchased the big bottle, you would also get a duffel bag that was Versace as well. So just to let y'all know, this was a special for Black Friday. So I don't know how long it's really going to last, if it's going to go through the holiday season, but I was excited. But while I bought this perfume, I really wanted to purchase it anyway. So I went ahead and I got it. I definitely loved it. This perfume right here is amazing. It doesn't have that floral scent that I normally tend to go to. It is very mature, but if I had to describe it, I would say it was sweet, it's soft, it's long-lasting, bright, fresh. All of those things come to mind when I smell this, and I've absolutely grown to love it. I was reading on the website a couple of things about it that I wanted to share with you. So the website says that it's a precious jewel of rare beauty characterized by its fresh, vibrant floral scent. I don't really get the floral in this scent, but maybe it's just me. I don't get that But the freshness of it, absolutely The vibrance of it, yes. It also goes on to say that its top notes are yuzu, pomegranate, and water. Its mid-notes are lotus flower, magnolia, and peony. And then its base notes are musk, mahogany, and amber. So I really get that whole musk, mahogany, and amber in this perfume. I really, really smell that. That's that mature scent that I kind of get with this fragrance. But the rest of it, you know, it can be kind of light and long-lasting. It's beautiful. I really, really enjoy it. So, like I shared with you guys a couple of posts ago, I'm liking my Marc Jacobs Perfect, and now I'm adding on to the list my Versace Bright Crystal. So if you haven't checked this fragrance out, do it. You will not be disappointed. It's very, very nice. So you can get it at Macy's, Sephora, any place that has a fragrance counter, really. It's not a brand new fragrance; it's been out for a while, so you can get it pretty much anywhere. And I don't know if I did a little close-up, I don't think I did, of the bottle here. So you can see it is a Bright Crystal with the Versace emblem on the top. So it's beautiful. You guys, get a chance, please make sure that you like, subscribe, and comment, as always. And I will see you guys later. Thanks for stopping by. Bye."

I just got the opportunity to try Versace Bright Crystal. You can see this is just like a beautiful bottle already So if you're looking for a really great gift for someone who is into a fruity, floral, musky scent, Versace Bright Crystal is the way to go. I actually personally love this smell. This fragrance is so, so good. It has all different types of flowers in it. It is a very, very light scent. As with fragrances, you spray it on, it smells different on everyone. This product, if you have someone in your family, friends, co-workers that you're going to be gifting for this holiday season, this is an amazing, amazing perfume. It is, like I said before, very florally but it’s very light. It's not going to give you a headache. It's not too strong. And nothing says luxury like this bottle right here. I mean, the cap is just stunning. The bottle is beautiful. This is the 1.7 ounces of the Versace Bright Crystal and it's, I think personally, a really, really great gift for anybody who loves more of a floral, musky type of fragrance. So definitely check it out. Check it out on my Macy's store And I hope you enjoyed my perfume review."
2;"Fragrance";"Versace Bright Crystal ";7;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q2HvqrbEg&pp=ygUXVmVyc2FjZSBCcmlnaHQgQ3J5c3RhbCA%3D";"Friends, what's good? All right, I'm going to talk to you about Versace Bright Crystal because this scent has totally been growing on me. And honestly, I loved it the first time I smelled it, but it's just not a fragrance I would personally wear. It's very feminine, and my taste is unisex, slightly leaning masculine on myself. Anyways, this is so sexy, okay? I would recommend this fragrance to the girls that want to be known as the freshest smelling person in your friend group, in your family. You're looking for that scent that's going to do everything for you. You know what I mean? You want a dumb reach fragrance. You want something that you can wear when you're running errands, something you can wear when you're at a party, going to the beach, going clubbing, you're on a date, anything, any kind of situation, and you want to smell fresh. This is such a good fragrance, okay? And you know what? I have been wearing more niche lately, but I have to say that just smelling this because I gave this to my sister, and she's already running through this thing, so she needs a full size of it. But I love it. I love it more than the Killian that she wears on herself, and I think it's Good Girl Gone Bad But yeah, this is just a universally sexy fragrance that makes people's eyes roll back. So if you're a guy watching this and you're like, \"I wouldn't get that.\" That's not my vibe,\" like if there's a lady in your life and you want her to smell amazing, you want to get her something that you know she'll feel confident in, something you know that she'll feel sexy in, and just that fragrance that you know when you just take a shower and then you apply a scent and you just feel like ten times better, that's sorry So that's the kind of fragrance that this is. So I was like, \"Sure, that sounds like a toad for a second, that's hilarious.\" But what else? Okay, the notes of this fragrance: pomegranate, there's also lotus, magnolia And I saw on Fragrantica that there's ice in the top of this, which is actually a very cool note. I've never seen ice in a fragrance before, but I guess that totally adds to this smell. It has a cooling effect to it, you know what I mean? Like, okay, it's fresh, it's relaxing, but it also cools you down a little bit. I don't know how they worked ice into this, but it smells great. And the dry down, there's musk and also a slight touch of amber just for a little bit of sweetness, a little bit of that comforting feeling. So Versace Bright Crystal is definitely one of my favorite scents on a woman right now, at least in the designer realm, absolutely. And you know how much I love Good Girl by Carolina Herrera. If you're a woman or a guy that it's a little bit too sweet for you, you know what I mean, and you want, you're like, \"Damn, I wish that that thing was fresher,\" then get this one. I would say that the longevity of this fragrance is at least, I smell this on my sister for over six hours easily. And she won't smell it on herself after four, and she's like, \"Yeah, I think it's gone.\" But she'll pass by me and I smell it. Like I've smelled this maybe, like no problem, eight hours on her. But she sprays it on her clothes, okay? She's not the person that sprays on her wrist once or twice and then she goes about her day and the scent is gone. She sprays it on her like the clavicle area, on her clothes, or on her back. So she has that really nice scent trail, but this thing shows out. And like I mentioned before, even I had to test this on myself just to see how it developed on my skin. And I did receive compliments on this fragrance when I wore it that first day. People were like, \"Whoa, that smells really nice.\" I got compliments from guys, compliments from girls. Yeah, so fresh, sexy, Versace Bright Crystal I love this And if [___], I mean if, if someone has a full size that they don't want, just know that I'm here Know that I'm here, and I would probably gift it to my sister because, yeah, she's, dude, she's going through this thing. She's going through this thing. She's had it for maybe like a month or less. So yeah, thanks for watching. I'll do another review after this, and subscribe if you haven't already. There's also a bell notification down there that alerts you when I post stuff, which is really cool. So yeah, suggestions in the comments. I'll leave a link in the description for my socials and for the fragrance if you want to check it out. All right, have a good one. I'll see you later. Bye."

2;"Fragrance";"Versace Bright Crystal ";9;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnLooipYjLo&pp=ygUYVmVyc2FjZSBCcmlnaHQgQ3J5c3RhbMKg";"Hello there, thank you for dropping by. Today, I'm excited because I finally got my hands on this one. This is Versace Bright Crystal Absolu. Last year, I shared my thoughts on the original Bright Crystal, and since then I have had several recommendations to try the Absolu or the intense version of the original or do some comparison between the two. Finally, I got my hands on it, so I'm gonna do that in this video. I won't be talking a lot about the original one since I already shared my views on this one previously, but I'm just gonna do a quick overview. This one was released in 2006. This one was announced to be a softer and luminous kind of fragrance, something fresh and watery. It really is a bright fragrance. I would say it's great for casual wear, especially on summer days. I would say it's girly, it's such a feminine fragrance, but it is not your feminine type that is sweet, fruity sweet, or gourmand which is quite popular nowadays when it comes to fruity fragrances. This one, I don't smell any sweetness in this perfume. This is your citrusy, bright floral fresh fragrance. I personally enjoy this perfume. I like to wear this during the hot season. I find this one easy to wear. It's casual, nothing offensive. It's fresh, yet I still find this feminine. So now moving on to Bright Crystal Absolu. After the success of the original Bright Crystal, they have released a more intense version of it. This one, by the way, is an EDT and Absolu is an EDP This was launched in 2013. Quite a long gap between the two because most flankers will be released like a year or two after the original, but this one was like from 2006, and this was 2013. So just by the bottle, you can see the softness, the gradient pink and white color of the original version. Well, the second one, the Absolu, is like it has silver and pink on it as well as the bottle. So the original one has a clear colored bottle in there, quite like a soft pink inside, while this one has more of a darker, stronger pink color. They both have this crystal-looking cup in there, so you can see with that Versace logo in the middle, looks like a silver coin there. This one is the 50 ml bottle, and this one is 30 ml, but the price, they're almost just the same. So this one, the Absolu one, is a little more pricey than the original. Perhaps because of the formulation, as this one is an EDP, while this says here EDT. So Bright Crystal Absolu has the exact same notes as the original one except that they added raspberry in here at the middle notes. I'm not surprised when I first got this one. I feel like it's just really the same as the original one. I cannot almost tell the difference between the two. I was looking for the raspberry in this perfume, but it isn't the kind of raspberry that I'm used to or I get to smell in other perfumes. So it has a citrusy opening, same as the original one, except that this one, the original, in the opening you are going to get that citrusy, a little bit of alcohol in it. There is an alcohol scent in the original one. Okay, so I noticed the original one, the moment it's sprayed on, I'm getting that rubbing alcohol scent for a few seconds, and then it would go down to the pomegranate, quite the fruity citrusy scent in there. While the Absolu one, I'm getting the fruity note right away. So I could get the pomegranate and the yuzu. This one is citrusy fruit. I actually love this one except for that few seconds of, like, I could get a rubbing alcohol which is quite strong to me, but it would disappear quickly and would turn into like a fresh fruity. I actually love this Well, the other one, surprisingly, is supposed to be the intense version, but I don't get the intensity on it. I feel like I just fell in love with this perfume all over again. I haven't worn this for a long time. The pomegranate on this one is really good. I like it combined with the yuzu, which makes it fresh. It's watery. As for the Absolu, they're almost kind of similar to me, but if you really pay attention, smell both of your wrists, there is a difference. This one is more citrusy to me, citrusy fresh floral, while this one is more, there is like a musky, I can get a little bit of a muskiness on this, on the Absolu one And I don't get that raspberry. I'm after the raspberry. I'm curious how it smells like on Bright Crystal, but I don't get any berry scent in here. They both have that distinct floral note that actually stands out in both of these perfumes. I think it's the peony or the lotus. So for Bright Crystal Absolu, there is a slight sourness on this perfume that lingers in the background. Perhaps it could be the raspberry. It may not be the sweet syrupy raspberry that I could smell on other raspberry perfumes. This one is quite sour, which is not in the original Bright Crystal. I don't get any sourness from this at all, in spite of this being citrusy. So now that I apply them side by side on both wrists, I could tell the difference than just by sniffing them in the bottle. Because in the bottle, Absolu is more, it's quite sweeter, it's fruitier compared to this, but on my skin it's different. I don't get sweetness at all. It's actually musky, and there's a bit of sourness in it. The original is still fresh with that pomegranate still in the background. It becomes more like a sweet floral fresh perfume. This one is musky, sour, and there's like a bit of a bitterness in it. I actually appreciate the original one more now that I have compared them both. The performance and longevity of these two perfumes, so Bright Crystal Absolu, it's noticeable on my skin. I could actually enjoy the scent, smell it on me without purposely sniffing it for about one to two hours, which is good enough for me. And it lasts on my skin for several hours, several, several hours, maybe seven to eight hours, while the original one is about five hours, five to six hours, which I'm not so disappointed because this is an EDT. I know some EDTs are quite long-lasting, but we know in general that EDT is lighter than EDP. If you ask me personally, I prefer the original one over the Absolu. I enjoy the smell of this one better. I just love this one, citrusy, sweet floral, and it's cooling. It's perfect for summer for me. I don't find this one cheap-smelling at all. I think it's classy and casual yet classy Really not much of a difference between the two, honestly. So if you enjoy the Absolu, and for me there's no need to get this one, and if you enjoy this, no need to get this one either, because they're almost the same. Not like other flankers that are quite different, really different from the original, so it's worth having them both or having all the variations in your collection. But this one, it's just they just added like one note in it It's just like the intense version of it. So for me, I have them both because the original was gifted to me by my husband and this one I blind-bought because I was expecting this to be something different, just like any other flankers to the original, but they just almost similar Good thing I just got the 30 ml. So that's it on my view for Versace Bright Crystal Absolu and comparison to the original Bright Crystal. Thank you for watching and see you again next time."

All right, so I have a little review treat for you today. We have Pure Instinct Pheromone Oil. Initially, I found this pheromone oil when I was researching like the top pheromone oils that there were. Initially, I found Sun Daisy Pheromone Oil, which I reviewed in a completely different video, and I'm like, I like it. It's cute, it's floral, it's very feminine, it's awesome. And then I decided I wanted to find out what other popular pheromone oils existed, and boom, Pure Instinct popped up. Once I found it, I saw that on Amazon it had 63,000 reviews. So I feel like this is not something that you see commonly where you just see thousands of reviews on things. So of course I had to do my little research. Come to find out, this was a part of a popular TikTok trend where they were discussing this fragrance. And I'm like, look, I don't even live on TikTok or any of that, so I didn't even know that this was a thing until that So I decided, you know what, it's on Amazon, might as well try it out. If I order it today, it'll be here tomorrow, and the turnaround time is phenomenal. So I decided to order it. On Amazon, I think it was like $16.95, something like that, around $17 if you round up. So it finally came in the mail today, and this is what it looks like in its little packaging, nice and cute. When I take it out, of course you see Pure Instinct on the label, the nice little wraparound label with the actual fragrance in there. So I tried it today. I tried it, and not only did I try it, I'm making the whole house sniff me because I want to see if you guys can smell the 63,000 reviews that we have here on Amazon. Initially, out of the bottle, you know, if you know me, you know I bathe in stuff like this because it's a lighter scent. If it's not one of those high-potency perfumes, I will add more because those are, you know, with the quality that comes with them, they're very potent so you don't need but just a few sprays. With something like this at this price bracket, I'm like, all right, I'm probably going to need just a little bit more to be able to smell, you know what I mean. So with this, you know, I did the little rollerball on my wrist, you know, dab it together a little bit, neck, shoulder, collarbone, all the good stuff. My first thought when I smelled this, I like it. Now, this is why I like it. I am partial to anything with musk in it. Musk, amber, vanilla, they are some of the most super sexy sensual scents, and I have a lot of really high-end fragrances, perfumes that have them in there that I absolutely am head over heels in love with. So once I see musk, I'm sold. You don't need to tell me anything else As long as you put a little musk in here, I'm good. The notes in here are essentially mango, mandarin, honey, cinnamon, and musk. The most potent notes are more of the mandarin and the musk with slight mango. You get the sweetness of the honey I don't really personally smell cinnamon, but you can definitely smell the fruit of it in addition to the musk, and I think that's a really nice combination. I decided to wear it, and I'm like, let me see how long this lasts. So when I decided to wear it, again, as I mentioned, I bathed in it. I bathed in it, okay. So when I bathed in it, the scent, it lasted, I want to say for me, around 4 hours. After that, it was very, very light and you really couldn't smell that I really had anything on. But I feel like if you consistently place this on, because this is a cute little travel size, seriously, like throw it in your purse, throw it in the car, wherever you want to put it. I do like the spray perfumes because I like the mist when it falls on me, but this has the rollerball. It's not a deal breaker. I feel like it's a good little travel size, so if you do need to reapply it throughout the day, it's easy to reapply because it's tiny and it fits everywhere. Again, for me, it only lasted about 4 hours, so it was about a 4-hour time frame. I wanted to try it with my partner. I'm like, let me see if he smells it because he didn't smell the first pheromone oil I'm like, we're up on each other, so how the hell do you not smell that? Same thing with my children. They didn't smell the first one. I'm like, I smell it, it smells good, but yes, it is a softer scent. This one is different. This is more pow in your face, right. When I had my little 12-year-old boy smell it, they were like, this smells good. Immediately they were like, I want some So I'm like, roll it on, roll it on So they're dabbing it up, bathing in it, and now all three of us smell the exact same. We all smell the exact same way. My boyfriend comes in from the store, I'm like, oh hey babe, you know, extra Like, you know, hey, hi, how you doing babe? He goes, babe, you smell good. So he did notice, which was super awesome because he didn't notice the other pheromone oil. So definite points for the fact that he could smell it, he noticed it, and he actually liked the scent. In addition to, like I said, my 12-year-old boys, they smelled it and they were like, oh, this smells good. And again, enough for them to actually wear it. Pre-teen boys, they’re something, so the fact that they liked it, I'm very impressed with it. This pheromone oil says it's imported from Italy, which is super awesome. It also says that it blends with your skin's natural pH to create a one-of-a-kind scent, which I know a lot of perfumes do because the same perfume that you wear is not going to smell the same on the next person. So if you wear Bright Crystals or Burberry Black, Chanel No. 5, it smells a certain way on you opposed to the next person only because I know it blends with your skin and your body's natural chemistry to create, you know, a one-of-a-kind scent So, you know, of course there is always that, so that's another awesome thing about it. It's not going to smell the same on everyone who decides to wear it. If you like this review or you like this feedback, I need you to go like, comment, and subscribe. Come show me some love, show me some love If there's something else that you would like to see me review, leave a comment because I'm interested in all of the scents. I love fragrances. I love things that smell good. Anything that's musky, I am absolutely sold with I definitely want to hear your feedback. Have you tried this? When you tried it, did your partner notice? Did your children notice? Did your friends, your co-workers, did they go, oh damn, you smell good, or was it just more of a passive thing? Again, once I saw those reviews, I'm like, I have, I absolutely have to try this. I guess technically I fell into the hype, but also I really wanted content and I was really curious. I was really curious. I'm like, this is a cute little travel bottle. It fits in the car, the purse, and all of that. Again, I hope you guys like this video. Please be sure to like, comment, and subscribe. See you in the next video Bye."

So it's got this like beautiful, I could say like floral scent. And pheromones are supposed to attract you to other people. Um, I'm married, happily married, so it's not like I'm out there trying to attract people to me, but there's something to be said about wearing something where people want to talk to you, they want to get to know you. So it's just like a little roller. And some of the comments I read on it are like people wear it just for themselves because it puts you in a better mood. So I got this, I think it smells so, so good. Um, is it a sex attractant perfume for me? I don't know about that yet. My husband hasn’t seemed to act any different with me with this on or not on. But I will say for myself, it puts me in a great mood. It kind of gives me like a blissful feeling and it just smells so delightful. So if you're looking for a really good perfume, I really like this roller. Um, it's great that it's pure pheromones, and I think you're gonna love it as well. So definitely check this one out."

As a married man with a young kid, I'm always looking for ways to improve my relationship with my wife. That's why I was excited to try out this product, which claims to have a potent pheromone formulation imported from Italy. One of the things I love about Pure Instinct Roll-On Perfume is its ability to blend with my skin's pH, creating a unique scent that is all my own. It's not overpowering like some fragrances, but rather a subtle hint that lingers throughout the day. I've received compliments from my wife and even strangers asking what I'm wearing. It's the perfect way to boost my confidence and attract positive attention. Another great feature of this product is its rich and silky texture, which is perfect for massages. As a busy parent, I often have muscle tension and stress that I need to relieve, and this perfume doubles as a massage oil. The aroma is soothing and calming, making it the perfect addition to my evening routine. Lastly, I appreciate that Pure Instinct Roll-On Perfume is compatible with a diffuser, allowing me to fill my home with the same wonderful scent. It's a great way to set the mood for a romantic evening or to create a relaxing atmosphere after a long day. The only thing I would say that I don't like about this product is the roll-on applicator, which can sometimes be a bit messy if I'm not careful. But it's a small price to pay for the benefits that come with using this product. Overall, I highly recommend Pure Instinct Roll-On Perfume for anyone looking to boost their confidence, enhance their relationships, or simply enjoy a unique and high-quality fragrance. It's a game changer for me, and I'm confident it will be for you too. That's it for this video. Thanks for watching."

I'm about to give you guys the full backstage Victoria's Secret Angel glam experience. Okay, one more backstage is Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. Share with you guys the backstage secrets of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. You can have the confidential beauty breakdown, which I would show you guys what it can, very confidential information, and we're gonna do our best here. A legitimate robe I've worn, which still smells like tanner and sweat and a buttery real human smell back to my first this Angel Fashion Show robe I'm mostly going to stick with Victoria's Secret beauty products, but I always do serum first. This one's my Clinique. Oh, my skin is thirsty. Before I start beating the face, going to apply some moisturizer. This one's Clé de Peau and it has some SPF in it. It is summertime right now, and you even get sun UV rays from the windows. So I'm going to prep the skin first, and then we're going to go into the beauty breakdown of the iconic bombshell beau. That's a lot of tint; my hand looks like some weird massacre just happened. I'm mixing Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Foundation with Dr. Hauschka's Tinted Bronzer Little bits of jasmine green tea on the brush too It's not too cakey. Touch of concealer I'm using Charlotte Tilbury's The Retoucher Stick. If you didn't know, Charlotte Tilbury actually did the makeup for the last Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. I really hope I'm doing you justice right now, Charlotte. I like to initially apply things with a brush but then blend it with my fingers. The warmth of your fingers helps to get the product to sink into your skin better. The retoucher stick really makes everything kind of disappear. I always be rocking my VS Angels white, so it's nice But a Wonder Glow from Charlotte Tilbury Okay, so now it's time to add some real fun and get into the inner workings of the Victoria's Secret backstage glam. I'm gonna follow this sheet to know how to do this stuff, and it starts with the eye. Now I really had to do some digging for this one: highlight in the inner corners, earthy brown tones for my makeup, individual lashes as needed Natural, well, that part I'm going to take the liberty to omit You don't want to see me trying to do individual lashes, at least not yet. We'll just curl them; you can call it a day. Allison says it is the Victoria's Secret Eye Palette, and it even gives me advice that I'm going to take for when I walk out onto the runway: get lit, probably for the second show, not the first. Go bold, be dramatic. Okay, I'm gonna get lit first, which is highlight the inner corners of my eyes. I'm just following the guidelines. I don't really know, this clean, maybe this one's cleaner. Oh yeah, I'm going to highlight my inner corners with champagne, which is fitting because the first step does get lit. Do my inner corners look lit? I don't know if it's meant to go that much down here. It's fine because they're lit. In the corners, pop out. I'm talking too much. I'm going to go into this deep bronzy color, which is earthy but sparkly, if the earth had stars inside of the earth. I like to go in a feline shape. I like to think of them as smoldering cat eyes and not just big ol' crazy eyes So go from the middle of the eye and go out. Kind of blend together It makes me feel like it's making it more like smouldering Individual lashes as needed. Well, we're not doing that. We want to look wide and awake on that runway. The one thing this job hasn't *shown* on me, considering that every makeup artist does it but it's not necessarily something I grew up watching my mother do every day. This is Victoria's Secret Major Lashes Mascara. Really pull that eyelid up, which looks psychotic, like a Clockwork Orange film, but that helps you get deep into the root of the lash. And I know that it sounds like it doesn't matter, but it does because it helps increase the definition of your eye shape. Clean mascara brush or wand to get out any clumps, one that's just poking down It is what it is My brows are a weird colour. Not only have they been dyed for a job, but they were lightened in the sun, so I don't even know. I'm using Anastasia Brow in this taupey color. I kind of want to do this microblade thing that everyone's doing where they just kind of tattoo their eyebrow on. I'm a little scared Maybe I should give it a shot. Facial imbalances are what makes us special. Get this show on the road here Before you know it, I'm going to have like a two-inch eyebrow. Both the cheek, natural-looking I can't believe that's the first robe I ever wore to a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. So many memories in these robes. When I read \"sculpted,\" I can give contour. The Charlotte Tilbury palette, and it says \"sculpt\" on it, so it kind of makes things easier. I like to do the checks, a little bit around here. I don't normally go too crazy with contour. Do it when I'm about to go on the VS runway or red carpet. A show could start any minute. I have a big old jaw, so I like to do a little contouring here to snatch the face. It's natural. Yeah, apple of the cheek is a dewy, rosy bronze. Well, handy dandy, I have my Victoria's Secret Glow On and On and On, which has a little rosy color here and a bronze color here. So into the honey lights because that's a bronzier color. The funny thing about the whole backstage VS Angel look is that it's surprisingly far more natural than you would think. That highlighter is poppin'. The same highlighter can go everywhere and make a nice complementary palette on your face. Get on the brow bone. Oh yeah Do you believe that I know what I'm doing? Okay, what we do, I mean, that's the vibrant one. Let's get in trouble all the time for sneaking extra makeup products backstage. Did the final steps now. Now on to lips. Taupe nudes lip with a little bit of shine Oh wait, wait, wait I wanted to do another step, which is really cool. This is the Lips Like Sugar Victoria's Secret Lip Scrub, and then start always dry and do a little sunburn. Another moment It tastes like sugar. Well, because there's sugar in it. No lie, my lips are so much softer already. See, velvet to the line, Nearly Nude by Victoria's Secret I'm just going to sharpen it. This is going to overdraw my top lip. See, just like that. I really like this lip liner. The overall color is nude with a little shine. That's contradictory because this is a Velvet Matte Lip Gloss by Victoria's Secret. That's not shiny. I'll buy the nude look, especially when you have an eye going on. I honestly love these velvet matte lips so much Wear them all summer My favorite product on the market, Extreme Lip Plumper, the Plump Me Up by Victoria's Secret, and it actually tingles because it kind of stings your lips into an allergic reaction and makes them blow up. No, it does tingle a little bit, but plump your lips, so it's a good little tingle. It is requesting a highlighter, and we are going to get that now. That lit champagne is going on the lips. I never know if I'm doing this right, but we're pretty much there as far as makeup goes. There's plenty more sheets on nails, which mine are not there. I'm thinking maybe I want to enhance the eye definition by making more of a cat eye. Estée Lauder Espresso Pencil Let me get it really tight to the lash line so you kind of don't really notice it's there. I hope that's the plan. I don't want to go in the angle that your lower lid is going, or your lower whatever you call that Lash line is a guy. Oh, I don't know what I just did there. There's more of it, so that's chill, just to increase definition. And lips maybe aren't too shiny Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Finish You want to look glowy, but you don't want to look greasy. She's out. Edges And then I think at the end, it's all about just kind of like playing around and figuring out what works best for your face. And I'm thinking maybe I'll increase the eyeshadow. And that's pretty much it. All right, so that's the final touch. I'm just adding a little body lotion, the Bombshell Paradise, which smells literally like summer. And I have a simmer in here, so I'm fixing that situation. And madre, that's a key step before you hit the runway is that you want to be wearing your lingerie. All right, so that is the actual step-by-step situation. An actual robe, no lies, lotion, how to do Thanks for watching, and I will see you guys next time. I'm just trying to turn this off."

Thank you for tuning in today. I know I haven't made a lot of content in a while, but you know, life gets busy. But I'm really trying my best to get creative and try to put out some videos But you know, I tend to get lazy sometimes, so it happens. But you know, my goal this year in 2021 was actually to create videos and just like, you know, do a lot of fun random stuff. And that's what I'm, you know, going to show you today is another thing in my random life, which is showing you some of my favorite Bombshell perfumes. So, the Bombshell perfumes are actually from Victoria's Secret, and they smell incredible. So, I actually got four of them in the same size for Christmas last year from my mom. So, thank you, Mom. And then I have the very first Bombshell that I got for Christmas in a gift set in 2019. And they came out with like, you know, more different kinds of, you know, scents throughout the Bombshell line. So, I was really happy. I got, I have all five of them now. So, yeah, I'm gonna actually show you all five of my scent perfumes and gonna tell you which one I like the most and what I like the least about them. But you know, I love them all the same, and they're the ones that I use the most on my, for my, for my body these days as a choice of a perfume before I go off anywhere. So, I'm gonna show you the first one, which is gonna be the Bombshell. Okay, so this is the first one, and it's, yeah, it's called Bombshell, just nothing else. Yeah, and this one actually has a champagne floral kind of scent to it, and it's really, it's really pretty. Like, when I, when I smell this, it smells like, smells like something I would want to wear with my, with like a bridesmaid's dress or like if I'm going to an elegant dinner or tea party. I think this one would kind of match the event in my opinion. But yeah, so this actually came from the other gift set I got in 2019 for Christmas. It came with the other perfumes, Heavenly Dream Angel and Tease. Tease is a really good one too, so I recommend that along with all the other Bombshells I'm going to show you. But I use this one actually the least out of my other Bombshells, but I mean, I use it when I have to go like, you know, traveling or go see somewhere overnight because, you know, it's convenient, but it smells really good. And one day I hope to get, like, you know, a bigger size of it, but right now I'm just gonna continue using this little travel size until it runs out. So, yeah, the next one I'm gonna show you is Bombshell Intense. Now, it is a really pretty, like, red. It's like in a little red bottle, which actually is attractive to me. I think when you see this bottle, you're gonna kind of see that the name does match its packaging. So, when I saw this for the first time, I was like, oh, this is definitely gonna be like a wine kind of like scent to it. But yeah, I haven't used this one like very much, so sometimes I forget that, I forget to use it, I forget what it smells like. So, oh yeah, it smells really good. It's, I don't know how to explain it It does have that floral, floral scent to it, but it also smells romantic in a way. I don't, I don't know what romantic would smell like to you, but like to me, it just has like a sweet sense to it, and it does kind of have like, I don't know, like, I don't know, I can just say it smells really sweet. So, intense and sweet. I don't know if that matches, but you know, I don't hate it. But actually, the first time I got it, I was kind of like, you know, taken aback because I couldn't smell it as much. And I got scared for a second. I was like, oh no, I'm losing my smell, COVID, oh no But after that, I was fine, no COVID at all. But yeah, I really like this one and try not to put too much on you because it is a little overpowering if you do. But yeah, this is a good scent. So, once again, this is the Bombshell Intense from Victoria's Secret. The next one I'm going to show you is Bombshell Seduction in a baby pink little bottle. It's really cute, I like it, it's really pretty. I do use this one probably the second most, I guess. I know I was looking back at my other perfumes like, which one do I use the most? What has the most, less liquid in it? But yeah, I'm gonna actually test this out again and like, you know, what it smells like Okay, so it kind of is relevant to the first Bombshell, but this one has like a soft kind of, a soft smell, which is like a soft, like rich kind of like perfume. It definitely like, is, it definitely screams perfume Like, this is definitely a perfume where it's got a soft touch to it and it's, I don't know, to me it's like, it smells like a slow dance. I don't know, like if I, how can I explain this? But it's just like, like the color just matches kind of like the herbal sense to it Like, it just smells like, smells slow, nice, definitely florally, but it's just like, it's just like, it's not as intense as the Bombshell Intense, that's for sure. But if you like, you know, subtle kind of perfume florally smells, this one is a really good one. So, once again, that is Bombshell Seduction. Now, this one, this one is also, this is Bombshell Passion. And this kind of looks like all the other Victoria's Secret perfume bottles or little packages that always come in this color. I feel like this is the theme color for Victoria's Secret. This one's actually a really good one. So, when I saw the word passion, I thought it was going to taste like a passion fruit drink or something like that. I don't know if I said taste, but it smells like a passion fruit drink. So, let's try this. And yes, I was right. It has like, oh my God, you know what it smells like? This smells like Tutti Frutti jelly beans. Okay, you guys all know the Jelly Bellies, the Tutti Frutti ones. I feel like that's what it smells like if you took a bite of it and then you smelled it, because I have done that before. But it also smells like, it smells like bubblegum a little bit. And I feel like it smells like bubble gum and then it smells like, like a pretty rose. So, it's like a rosy bubblegum sort of flavor. So, it's definitely like a little bit, it's sweet, but it's got like kind of like the candy smell to it, but not too much. So, if you're not a big fan of overly sweet vanilla, like all those fruity kind of perfumes, this one just has a touch of a smell, like a smell to it. Sorry, I had a little bit of an interruption earlier, but like I said before, it smells really good. I recommend this one. This is probably my third favorite perfume that I use, but it's right up my alley and I don't hate it. I love it It smells good. So yeah, that once again is Bombshell Passion. Next one I'm going to show you is, this one's actually my top favorite. This is Bombshell Gold. I was attracted to this the moment I saw it. And when I asked my mom, or when I told my mom that I really wanted this for Christmas, like, you know, she was really sweet and remembered what I wanted. But I swear, the moment I smelled this, I was in love. So, I'm gonna test it out on my hand. So, just put it kind of on my arm. Oh my gosh. It smells like gold, but with a richer, prettier scent to it. You can tell, it's gonna be the holy grail of all Bombshells. That's just my opinion, but no, it's just, it's not overly intense. It's just, it's like a perfect balance between like floral and essence and richness, and it just smells so good. I can't even like explain what the beauty of this is See, I can't even talk because it just smells that good. Not even being dramatic, but yeah, it's very pretty. It's a very beautiful scent. I wear it all the time before like I go off to work or go off in general, but it's always on my dresser and it's the first one I grab and I enjoy so much. But yeah, that's actually my favorite one out of all the Bombshells. So once again, Bombshell Gold, go out and get it now. So yeah, that is all my Bombshell perfumes that I have. Those are actually the only five that Victoria's Secret carries. I do hope that they make more, more different ones from the Bombshell collection. I'm sure they will, probably like, you know, more towards Christmas time when people like, you know, start buying gifts for their loved ones and significant others. So I can't wait to see more on that. But once again, I hope that you enjoyed every single one. Whoops, I hope you enjoyed every single one of these perfumes. I'll once again show you every single one that I have. I can't carry all of them, but this is all them and they're all in different colors. How pretty But yeah, so I hope you enjoyed my review. I did my very best to describe every single one of these perfumes and I'll put a link down below where you can get them on Victoria's Secret. And let me know if you guys like the Bombshell perfumes as well. I really like to know which one of all those five was your favorite. So, thank you for tuning in and I will see you on the next video. Bye-bye."
4;"Fragrance";"Victoria's Secret Bombshell";15;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mpqMASuaOE&pp=ygUbVmljdG9yaWEncyBTZWNyZXQgQm9tYnNoZWxs";"Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel. So today I'm very excited. The brand new Victoria's Secret Bombshell Passion has just arrived, a flanker from the Bombshell range. I'm loving it so far and I wanted to give you my first impressions, my review and everything, and also compare it to the other Bombshells that are in the range that are available right now. So, um, I've tried these so many times before, but I thought for this video I just ordered the rollerballs of the original, the intense version and the seduction version, and sort of take you through the difference between all four and do a comparison. What's my favorite? If you're new here, then welcome. We are all about perfumes here, so check out my hundreds and hundreds of other perfume videos. And if you're a regular and you haven't subscribed yet, then do hit that subscribe button and show your support. I really appreciate it. And as always, I will leave links down below to where you can get all these perfumes I talk about in the UK, Europe, US, Canada, and Australia. Cool So of course, Victoria's Secret Bombshell Original is their best seller. It's, um, a sort of worldwide bestseller across many different, like across all perfumes. It's very well known. But over the years they've released different editions of it. So the first thing to note about these four is that they're all different, okay? It is not that they've done Bombshell and then these are all just slightly different twists on Bombshell. They're actually four completely independent fragrances, different from each other. And so if you like one, it doesn't mean you'll like another, if that makes sense. So I'm going to start off with the original, not the original, the brand new one, Bombshell Passion. This literally has just come out, um, I think this week. So it came in the classic Victoria's Secret box with the lines on, you know, classic Victoria's Secret. It's a very good quality, like sturdy box Um, the price was kind of cheaper than your normal designer perfumes, but still not cheap. Um, I think this was about 40 pounds maybe. So in terms of, um, impressions and everything, I love this color. It's my favorite color. Um, you mean you can see I'm kind of wearing these type of colors and I really like it and I actually really love the smell Um, even over the others actually This is the most, um, similar to a lot of main street perfumes. So if you like things like Jimmy Choo, YSL Mon Paris, um, Opium, you know, a lot of the sort of big best-selling patchouli perfumes, you will like this. This is basically patchouli, rose, and peony. So very similar ingredients to YSL Mon Paris except without the, um, fruity notes in. I really, really like it. Um, the rose is not overwhelming at all. This is kind of a bit like Miss Dior as well. If you like Miss Dior, um, I can see they've thought about what's popular right now and that's what they brought out. I think this will be successful for Christmas. If you're looking for, um, a present like this festive season and you know someone likes those type of mainstream perfumes like Jimmy Choo, then this I think they will also like. Um, I really like it. I, yeah, it's definitely my favorite from before because I love the bottle, the branding and I love the smell. This patchouli rose peony, peony makes it adds a little bit of light and freshness, but it's predominantly a sexy patchouli rose. Really, really nice and modern smell. I love it So that's Bombshell Passion, the new one. So if we go back to the original Bombshell that came out many years ago, um, so this is actually, I always felt that this was named wrongly because the smell of this to me is not a bombshell. It's like a, um, more innocent. You know, if you think of bombshell, you think of like boom, wow, big smell, you know Um, this isn't what this is like and the main sort of note is passion fruit. So it's fruity, but it also has very fresh citrusy notes in pineapple, orange, strawberry has peony in its very light and I would say kind of innocent. Um, this is more like girly whereas I feel like passion is more womanly Um, this, I don't find it over the sort of sexy or Victoria's Secret. I find it young and free and fun. That makes sense. So I do like it as a smell but I've always found the branding, the name to be wrong. Um, it does have some vanilla in but you can't really get that much vanilla from it and in terms of lasting power, I am finding that passion is lasting better than original So if you like your passion fruits, if you like your fresh fruity everyday type smells, then for sure you will like this. If you want something a bit more stronger and sexier, then I'd recommend passion. So next we have the intense version. So when this came out, I thought it was just going to be a stronger version of the original. It's actually a totally different smell, totally different fragrance and this is my second favorite after passion. It's vanilla and cherry and I'd say it's at least 50% of the smell is vanilla. So this definitely is like sexy It is what I'd expect from a Victoria's Secret fragrance and then the cherry is a fruity cherry. It's not a deep heavy cherry, it's fruity fresh cherry. Um, and this one has peony in and you can actually smell the peony. It smells has a freshness to it. 

Correction: It smells has a freshness to it. So it's not as deep and dark and heavy as it looks. The packaging makes it look like it's going to be but it is still much, um, deeper and sexier than original bombshell So if you like cherry, then you'd like this. You like vanilla, like this. Although a lot of people don't like patchouli so they wouldn't like passion but if you want a strong one that doesn't have patchouli in then intense is the one I recommend. And then lastly we have Seduction, the eau de parfum. Now what's really interesting about this is because the branding and everything is lighter that usually means the fragrance is going to be lighter as well as a flanker and being this is totally different to the other three, it is a herby floral. So it actually has a lot of sage in and what's interesting is when this first came out, I'm thinking it's going to be really weak and rubbish. It's actually really strong. Um, the sage smell really follows you around. It also has tuberose in which, um, is quite strong and it has a powder in a softness to it as well. So if you like floral smells it to me, this smells floral, slightly herbal and aromatic If you like that type of thing then yeah. See even just smelling it near me that it's strong. I'm really getting the tuberose. It's definitely, this is more of a bombshell type smell like it's like a strong flowery aromatic smell It's kind of like the smell of when you go into a spa. Yeah, that kind of spa smell. It's, it's really nice and yeah, it's strong. I wouldn't say it's overly sexy like those notes aren't really evening notes, date night notes. You definitely wear this during the day but if you like that type of herbal aromatherapy almost type smell then seduction is the one. Cool So that's my rundown and those four are really quite different as you can see and there are other flankers, um, but they aren't listed on their website right now. I'm not sure they're sold right now like there was a summer one that came out this year, paradise thing was cool but that's gone Um, so yeah, those are the four of the moment and of course the, the man of the moment, the perfume of the moment is passion which I am loving and definitely recommend. So let me know what your favorite bombshell, um, version is. Do you like the original? Have you tried the new one or what's your favorite Victoria's Secret perfume in general? Um, I have done quite a few Victoria's Secret videos so I'll leave them linked down below including a rundown of all of their fragrance mists. So check that out. I went a bit crazy on the website. Um, but yeah, that's it guys. So thanks so much for watching as always and I will see you in the next video. Bye."

First thing, this has been reformulated. They changed a little bit of the oil over the years, not in the way on how it smells, but in the performance category. So, it's not so strong like it used to be, but it's still strong enough. Be aware it has been reformulated. Second thing you should know, super price value proposition You get a cheap fragrance that has solid performance that the ladies love, that is very versatile Third thing you should know, one of the best fresh fragrances on the market. Hey, this is composed by Maurice Roucel. He's a master perfumer. He makes super gorgeous, expensive fragrances, but he can also do the cheapies and the goodies. Morning, I want to see if some cool people are here to ask if they like it or not Well, great price value made by a master perfumer. Hello, can you tell me if you like this perfume? Yeah, just on a man. Is this appropriate? It's good, right? Yeah, fresh and clean. Thank you Fourth thing you should know, ladies love this fragrance Man, you can get a $400 Creed fragrance You can get a $500 Oud fragrance. Most of the time, this fragrance will score better in the category of do ladies love it or not. So, fourth thing you should know, a mega star when it comes to ladies' reactions. Fifth thing you should know, all-season, all-occasion versatile fragrance. So, it repeats itself a little bit. I'm going to conclude a little bit with the fifth and last point. You can always smell fresh and clean. You can always smell clean with this one. You will never offend people You are noticeable with this in a kind way, just like you took a nice shower or you were wearing a great deodorant or you had some nice shower gel. You will be assimilated, and that is the thing that's going on here in Miami. So, in conclusion, this fragrance is a very cheap, long-lasting, ladies-love-it fragrance that gets you throughout the year and all-season, all-occasion. And to me, it's one of the best price value fragrances on the market, and that's also one of the reasons why this fragrance is Amazon's number one top seller. Thank you for watching my videos. I love you Peace, guys. Office for Man is a best It is our first release. It was our first baby. It has cedarwood, patchouli, vetiver. This is a CEO fragrance. It stays fresh from the start to the end. Some fragrances start with a nice top note, and then they die down. They don't last long, or they turn sweet Both is not in our fragrance. We keep our word with a long-lasting fresh fragrance, and it stays fresh in the office. You want to stay fresh and clean. You don't want to turn it into a super sweet fragrance and just the top to have fresh. So, this one is perfect for the office, for the school, for the daytime. In general, daytime fresh and clean situations. And it has a good dose of pepper, which gives it a slight edgy note, like a confident approach to not just be a passive person in the everyday life but actually being a go-getter and going for what you want. This fragrance will 100 percent help you with that."

I appreciate you clicking on that video, as always. We are back with another \"Is This Worth It?\" video, where I go over a fragrance, talk about it, maybe it's been hyped at one point, maybe it's hyped today, and I tell you if it is still worth it to buy right now. Now I can say with 100% certainty that this fragrance we’re talking about today is absolutely hyped and hyped by the biggest fragrance YouTuber known, Jeremy Fragrance. We all know who he is, at least most of us do. If you're watching this video, odds are very high that you have watched a Jeremy video. Some of you guys are pushed here through the YouTube algorithm and you might not even know why you clicked on a fragrance video. I encourage you to stick around and watch this entire video. But the scent we are talking about today is, of course, Nautica Voyage. I'm going to tell you what kind of fragrance Nautica Voyage is, what type of performance I get from it, how much it actually costs, and do I like it? Is it worth it in 2023? Let's jump into it. Really quickly guys, we are approaching 5,000 subscribers and I could not be happier. I appreciate all the support you guys have shown me. I just did a 4K giveaway on a bottle of Juicy Couture's Dirty English, and I plan on doing another 5,000 subscriber giveaway. So help me get there. We're not too far away, maybe 700 some odd subscribers short. As soon as we hit 5K, I'm gonna do another giveaway. But I want to thank you guys for supporting the channel. As always, like this video, subscribe to the channel, and hit that bell so you know when I upload new content. So, Nautica Voyage. Nautica Voyage has been around since around the mid-2000s, I want to say 2005 or 2006. At that time, it was a really popular scent. It’s one of those ones that was sort of featured if you walked into a Macy's. This was one that was sort of pushed into your face advertising-wise from the people working the fragrance counter. Chances are you probably smelled Nautica Voyage on a test strip, someone shoved this one in your face. Fast forward to just a few years ago, with this explosion of online YouTube content surrounding fragrances. At the forefront of that was, of course, Jeremy Fragrance. Jeremy has over a million subscribers on YouTube and TikTok, and this is a fragrance that he's talked about pretty much from the beginning and continues to talk about to this day. So it begs the question, is this a fragrance that is worth it when it's almost 20 years old? At this point, is it still worth it? Is it still worth the hype? Is it still worth the biggest fragrance YouTuber pushing this constantly? Well, let's talk about the scent first. Let's look at the atomizer. I already know what the atomizer is—total garbage. Complete garbage atomizer There are times where nothing even comes out. When I wear this, I have to spray it basically 50 times. Horrible atomizer Now, what do I get in the air? Wow, it's in the air. It's a very unique scent. There are not very many fragrances that I can put my finger on that smell quite like this. A lot of people get instantly this cucumber, which I get that I get sort of a grassy, green fruitiness to this. It's more of a pickled cucumber, so it's a little sour, especially on skin. I think some of that might be the aquatic accord that the perfumer was going for on this By the way, the perfumer on this is Maurice Roucel, and he’s done a lot of fragrances that you guys would probably know. Now, immediately right off the top, there is an alcohol blast. So you get some perfume with alcohol, but it doesn't last very long. It kind of goes away pretty quickly Then I start getting that sort of pickled greenness to this. When I say pickled, I don't want you to think like sour pickles. It's not overtly sour. It does have a little bit of sour, but that sweetness also balances it out, so it's actually a nice sort of juxtaposition of the two. I'm also picking up sort of a woodiness to this. It's really fresh. It's a little floral. There is again that fruitiness. There's really little to no citrus in here, so you might expect citrus from an aquatic scent, something called Nautica Voyage, but it really does, for me, evoke the sense of being on the ocean. Which, look, it could be the bottle, it could be just sort of the presentation and the juice color and the name of the fragrance being Nautica Voyage, but I really do get this sort of just feeling of being on the ocean, being on a boat, and it's not a bad thing. I don't necessarily really get a specific fruit from this, but it is fruity. It reminds you of maybe something in the vein of an apple or even a peach. It has sweetness to it, but it's not cloying. It's just really well-blended. You'd be surprised with a cheap fragrance like this. I'll get into cost and everything in a minute, but for such a cheap fragrance, you actually are getting something that smells of a higher quality, that's blended really well, that doesn't smell overly synthetic or cheap. This is cheap. One of the things that Jeremy totes all the time is that this fragrance is Amazon's number one top seller. I don't know if that's the case. I'm actually gonna try to put a graphic here if I can to see what the number one most sold men's fragrance is, but I can see why it would be It's really versatile. This is a great warm weather scent. However, it also has aspects to it that make this more signature-worthy than just a summer freshie. I think that's where it's best utilized, as a summer fresh fragrance. I did a video not too long ago of some of my favorite gym fragrances, so I think this would also be ideal for throwing in your gym bag, just having a clean smell if you're working out. I know some people don't like fragrance when working out. It doesn't mean you have to douse yourself in it. You can put a couple of sprays on, you're not gonna offend anyone. If you're offending someone with a couple of sprays of Nautica Voyage at the gym, they must have sensitive noses, and I can appreciate that some people do. But for the most part, this is not a massive projector. This is not going to choke anybody out. You will get noticed, I think, to some degree, but again, you're gonna have to spray a little heavier. It's just not a big projector. It sits closer to the skin. The notes for Nautica Voyage: top notes are apple and green leaves; mid notes are lotus and mimosa; and the base notes are musk, cedar, oakmoss, and amber. Getting to the price on Amazon, if you went and bought this today, you're gonna spend under $20. It's around $18. I'm gonna link it down below, but I'm also gonna link The Perfume Spot, which is even cheaper. I think you can get it for like $15 through The Perfume Spot, and they have really fast shipping. That's my preferred sort of discount site that I use in addition to some others, but they usually have what I'm looking for, for really cheap. Nautica Voyage has a million flankers that can normally be found at discounters and in rack stores. That's also what I should add: this is popping up all the time at Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and Burlington. So you can usually find this in those stores. The price is going to be a tiny bit more than what I just told you guys. It's usually around $19.99, just over $20 for this. Sometimes it's cheaper than that, sometimes it is around $16.99. It depends on the store and the day. But it has a million flankers that are all decent, they're all good There are some that are better than others, some that I could do without. I say stick to the OG This is still the best one to grab if you're going to grab a Nautica Voyage. So yeah, I think this is worth it in 2023. You're really not losing much, right? Either way, you slice it, you're paying under $20. But I also think what you're getting with that $20 is something original. It doesn't smell like anything else. There are things that I've smelled that remind me of Nautica Voyage that came out later. I think at the time, this wasn't trying to copy anything. This was trying to be an original, a fresh aquatic men's scent that doesn't lean necessarily youthful. To me, I think young guys can easily pull this off, I think older guys can easily pull this off There's nothing in here that says youthful or mature. It's dead center, gonna appease everyone. Women really like this scent, and I've been complimented wearing this by women. I think they just like that blend of sweet, woody freshness, slightly aquatic. There is a little saltiness to it. It's just a really clean scent that doesn't come across as overly soapy or shower-gel-like. It has a lot of greenness to it, despite its presentation. You might think this is a blue fragrance, but it has a lot of greenness to it, woodiness, and cleanliness, and I love it. I want to say that my daughter chose this in one of my first videos that I did for the channel I want to say that she chose this as her favorite cheapie. Okay, good. Now smell this one and tell me which one you like better: the one you just smelled or the one I got? Which one do you like better? This one. Okay then, I did, guys. Emmy has spoken. The winner of today's cheepie challenge, judged by the one and only Amelia, my three-year-old daughter, is.. You want to hold it up? Cheap Nautica Voyage wins This is one that many people like, many people will enjoy. You don't have to think too much about it. The fragrance snobs probably have something to say about it. It's not up to their caliber of scent, especially if you found it at a rack store. But we don't care what the fragrance snobs think. Let them do what they do. But in my opinion, Nautica Voyage is worth it in 2023 and you really can't go wrong for your money spent here. Great scent in terms of longevity It actually lasts a good amount of time. I mean, you're getting pretty much a full day's wear. It dries down into this really nice salty, woody musk. Just pleasant and you can still smell it Again, not a massive projector, but it projects decently well for the first hour, so you will get noticed with it on. I wouldn't even say it's necessarily a familiar scent. I truly think this is an original and one that is worth you considering grabbing for your collection. Nautica Voyage That's all I have today, guys. Let me know in the comment section down below: do you own a bottle of Nautica Voyage? Have you owned a bottle in the past? What are your thoughts on it?

Today's video is going to be my first impression, my first time smelling.. I probably shouldn't use absolutes, but I would say based on my feed, the most pushed and recommended cheap fragrance for men. And yes, it's more of a summer fragrance and we're coming into fall, so this is kind of, you know, a little behind. But I wanted to see what the hype was about. I had to smell it for myself and see, is it really worth the money, the thirty dollars? Is it really all that these influencers praise? So, let's see. This is Nautica Voyage. I was just randomly in Marshalls the other day and I saw it because I've never seen Nautica Voyage in the rack stores. I've seen other flankers like Nautica Blue or Nautica This, Nautica That, but I've never seen Nautica Voyage. I saw it in Marshalls and I thought it must be a sign from above that it's time that I smell this fragrance because it's not new It's been out since about 2006. So, this has a pretty interesting note list. Notes like apple, mimosa, lotus One spray Beautiful It has some musk, cedar, oakmoss, and amber. Whew, strong in the air, let me tell you So, this is a woody aquatic fragrance for men. I mean, obviously, with a name like Nautica Voyage, it's got to be pretty blue. Okay, so on the strip, I definitely get a little bit of the muskiness because when you smell it from the cap, from the atomizer, it kind of smells like just cucumber water. It's like an interesting way to describe it, but that's kind of what it reminded me of. Just like you go into this spa and you get the water with the cucumbers in it. It's not bad. It's not bad at all. It doesn't smell. Okay, it smells a little cheap, I'm not gonna lie, but it doesn't smell really cheap, like super synthetic or anything like that. And I was actually pretty surprised looking up the reviews on this that I was kind of expecting more of a divide. I was expecting more of like 50/50 people love it, people hate it, but it's pretty much an overall very loved fragrance. Very praised The performance is not that great. A lot of people say it only lasts maybe like four or five hours, but you know, for a thirty-dollar bottle, what can you complain about? It has like this kind of greenness to it, this herbiness, and you definitely get the apple and that lotus note, the floral note. It's nice. It's not bad at all. I think this is definitely like a good safe wear. You know, you're going to work and you don't want to spend a bunch of money. I say it's fine. Like, you're not gonna upset anyone by wearing it. But I think it's just so... It's just kind of boring and overdone. I think I saw a comment online saying like, \"wear this if you want to smell like every girl's ex-boyfriend.\" But it's nice It smells like a very nice fresh out of the shower kind of scent. Very clean I think that if you literally have only thirty dollars in your bank account and you need a fragrance, this is good. I need to pay 30 bucks for this though. I think I paid 15-20 bucks, but I got it from a rack store. So, like I said, every time I go, I always see all these flankers all the time. So, you can find this at any rack store for really cheap. Great for the summer Definitely for the summer I think it's definitely good. Like, I would wear this if I were a guy. I would wear this to, like, the beach. I don't know if I would just wear it as a daily, you know, scent. Maybe work, maybe, but I definitely could see myself if I was a guy wearing this at the beach. So nice. It's always nice to be pleasantly surprised, right? Alright, I wanted to come on here and I wanted to smell it and I wanted to hate it and, you know, rain on the parade of, you know, these influencers that are pushing it. It's so good, it's the best fragrance ever, blah blah blah I give it a solid. Everything considered: price, performance, smell, I give it a solid seven. Is it ever gonna get anywhere? I don't know. My brother all of a sudden keeps coming over as I'm collecting more bottles and, you know, more men's fragrances in my collection. My brother keeps coming over and stealing bottles and swapping them. He stole my Le Mans bottle, you know. Every time he comes over he's like, \"I want to try that, I want to try that, I'll try that.\" Like, go for it, I'm not gonna wear it. So, anyway, I feel like I'm kind of rambling a little. So, not bad at all, Nautica Voyage. Thank you guys so much for watching. Leave a comment below with your opinions on Nautica Voyage. I would love to hear them, and I'll see you next time. Bye."

It doesn't matter if I drop the bottle. So you go on the internet, you got all these influencers talking about Nautica Voyage. I'm going to put a compilation of these guys saying Nautica Voyage, 99% of fragrances lose against this fragrance Nautica Voyage, this is a must-buy. Nautica Voyage, Nautica Voyage, Nautica Voyage, Nautica Voyage, Nautica Voyage, Nautica Voyage This is what they call the king of cheapies. You go on TikTok, you see Jeremy Fragrance saying this is amazing and this smells better than expensive fragrances and it's much better and all this stuff. I swear to God, this is the fun fact. Actually, this is my second bottle of Nautica Voyage, right? What happened to the first? If this video gets like 1000 likes, I will take Nautica Voyage and throw it in the river because this fragrance right here is one of the most overrated fragrances in the game to ever exist. It literally smells like a cucumber salad. If you want to smell like a cucumber salad, this fragrance is for you. Okay, now listen. A lot of people are going to tell us this fragrance is one of the greatest Freshies, one of the greatest cheapies in the game. This one right here gets a lot of compliments. If you have to pick one fragrance, it'll be Nautica Voyage. This fragrance right here is not worth your money. I think you should just save that $20 or $15. I think I got this for like $14 off TikTok with a coupon and just spent it on something else. Spend a little bit more money and get a different fragrance because this one right here does not live up to the hype. It smells like a cucumber salad, bro. It only lasts like 2 hours. It's sharp as hell. I used to wear this one to the gym and even then I was like I don't want to wear this to the gym anymore. It's one of the most overrated fragrances in the game. I feel like I was so mean to this fragrance but like it's true, it's one of the most overrated fragrances in the game All these influencers are like, \"Oh, dude, Nautica Voyage, buy it.\" Jeremy Fragrance is over here I love Jeremy I love Jeremy Jeremy is a legend in the game, but why this? Like, this is not that great. My first bottle, I gave it away. I said here, I didn't want it. Like, I wore it to the gym two, three times and I was running and all of a sudden like the sharp cucumbers just hit my nose and I don't want to smell cucumbers, bro This is sharp synthetic. If you're looking to get a cheapie, I'll do a whole other video on it. I have a cute little Montblanc Legend Spirit. It's like this big. It's so cute. It's a much better cheapie than this one here. Montblanc Legend Spirit smells fresher, cleaner, sexier, better quality than Nautica Voyage. So this video right here might be a bit mean to Nautica Voyage. It might be a bit harsh, it might be a bit too honest, I guess, but I don't think you should own this fragrance. I don't think this fragrance is worth having in your collection. I believe you should save up a little bit of money, maybe like $40 or $50, which is like $30 if you don't buy this, and just buy yourself maybe Versace Pour Homme. Maybe you can get yourself Versace Dylan Blue. Maybe you could get Montblanc Legend Spirit. Maybe you're able to get yourself Azzaro Chrome Extreme or Armani because all those fragrances are 100 times better than this one. I will conclude this video by saying this is the most overrated fragrance in the game. If you're going to spend $20 on it, you just wasted your money. Have a good day."

So, welcome back if you've been here before, and if you're new to my channel, welcome. Pleased to have you here. Thanks for dropping by on this nice sunny day here in the UK. It's very fresh outside, but it's nice and sunny, nice to see a bit of sun. So yeah, Pink Sands here. Oh gosh, I love Pink Sands. This is one from the core collection, isn't it? It's been around a long while and I feel it's a classic. I'm pretty sure if you're a Yankee Candle fan, that you have come across Pink Sands in some shape or form, like a wax melt, a votive, but I'm pretty sure that you've come across Pink Sands on your journey with Yankee Candle, and it is beautiful. I absolutely love this one. Look at that beautiful label there, nice pink sands with a beach, very exotic-looking, very hot-looking This candle with its beautiful baby pink wax there, I just feel it screams summer vibes. It is great for the summertime. I personally love using this in the summer, but I tend to use it for late afternoon going into the evening, and then I'll extinguish this and light my Midsummer's Night, which I absolutely adore. And the two of these together, I just feel, complement each other and work really, really well. So yeah, let's jump in with Yankee Candle's description. So, we have it's an exotic island escape, a beautiful mix of bright citrus, sweet florals, and spicy vanilla notes. We have the top notes of citrus, melon, and berry. We have mid notes of osmanthus. We have the base of spicy vanilla, musk, and woody notes. So, like I say, please comment down below if you've tried this. I have looked at reviews and this seems to be a big favorite with everybody. Everybody's saying that it's very comforting, it reminds them of the summertime. Lots of memories, I think, with people where they've had this one in their collection for so long, and when you light it, it just brings back their memories, doesn't it? Summertime, if you've used it then A really great candle I'd say that it brings that warm, happy vibe. It's very soft, very relaxing and comforting, and soothing. It's beautifully blended, very smooth. It's a fruity floral, a bit like a warm watermelon. It's for summer, but for me, evening summer, and I find it very warm, fresh. I love this candle. And although it is a summertime candle and it's great for summer vibes and it does remind me of the warmer weather, I have been known to light this in the wintertime. I actually took down my decorations on the second of January and I lit this candle. Dreary January, I just wasn't feeling it that day, and I lit this candle and it just brings that sort of warm, happy vibe. Puts me in a good mood This is definitely a good mood candle, so if you want to feel in a good mood, it's uplifting in a warm, comforting way. And yeah, if you have not tried this, this is one you really do need to try and put into your collection, honestly You will not be disappointed. There are some scents out there that I would say are not for everybody, they're not everybody's cup of tea, but this one, no, I just feel that I'm sure that this one would be everyone's cup of tea. Personally, I haven't met anybody that doesn't like Pink Sands. Some people have said it's a little bit light for them. I don't feel that I feel it's very warm and it does go all throughout the room, but you can always, like with me, I burn a wax melt in my centerpiece, which just takes it up to another level and then it really does go throughout the house. I would give this a good 7 out of 10 throw rating, definitely. My family loves this one. Same, they say it's summertime, they can smell that watermelon vibe from it, that sort of fruitiness. Both of my children say that it reminds them of sweets when they smell it and it's just a pleasant smell and, like I say, one that I think everybody would enjoy. Great one if you've got people coming over in the summertime. You know, it's a great one to have in the background there. It's not going to offend everyone, I don't think. I just think that everybody will enjoy this. So yeah, Pink Sands. And like I say, I will not be without this one. This is one that's permanently in my collection and I use it all the time. Love it, very happy, comforting candle So that's Pink Sands for you. So next week, what have I got coming up? I have actually got on the way another couple of the Sakura Blossom Festival collection. I haven't got my hands on the mango ice cream yet, but I have got my hands on the other two, which are the Berry Mochi and the Tranquil Garden. So I do have them coming to me I also have a coming one that I tried years and years and years ago. I've had it in a centerpiece and wax melt since, but I haven't actually had the candle for quite a while, and that's Black Coconut. I have that coming because it's beautiful. I don't know if you tried that one, but it's really beautiful. So I will be reviewing that in the weeks coming up or might save it for a bit warmer times. But yeah, I'm going to have some classic ones, some from the core collection coming up. I feel that we haven't gone over. Also, I'll be jumping back onto the Yankee Candle Elevations because I've got plenty of them to review and get through. I've got the Chocolate Eggs already, which is the one they're bringing back out for Easter, a re-release there. So I will be doing that over the Easter time. So yeah, I've got lots coming up. So don't miss it. Please like and subscribe, hit that notification bell so you don't miss it when I upload a video. And yeah, that's what's coming up. And by the way, I always review in the large jars. I buy them in this large size, it's just how I like them. And I will be buying every one they bring out this year in this original jar shape. So have a really good week, whatever you're up to. Comment down below, I love to hear from you. I read all the comments and I do try my best to reply to you all. So yeah, have a really good week and I will be back next week. Bye."

In today's video, I'm gonna be doing a review on the Yankee Candle of Pink Sands. So let's get right into this review. One of the reasons why I purchased this candle was, first of all, I am a Yankee Candle fanatic. My wife and I love the Yankee Candle brand; we love the different scents and aromas they have. I just picked this one up for Mother's Day for her. This is actually the 13-ounce jar. This is the Pink Sands, like I said earlier. This is the double wick here, so as you can see, it has two double wicks here, and I have to tell you that the smell is just so wonderful. It has a great scent to it. It makes your room smell super good, and this particular candle smells like a fruity melon type. So it's a very nice smell, and it's definitely something that you can use for a long time. It comes, like I said, with two wicks, and these are very high quality. When you're burning the candle, both melt at the same time, and you can use this for hours long. It's going to make your whole room smell good. So let me go ahead and just demonstrate to you how it's going to look. Okay, so I got my little electric lighter here, so I'm going to go ahead and light this side up here. Go ahead and light the other side. And there we have it. Like I said, I am a Yankee Candle fanatic, and this Pink Sands is just a super wonderful smell. It's a great gift for a friend or a mother or whoever likes candles. It's going to have your whole room smelling nice, fruity, melon type of citrus, and this is definitely a candle that I recommend. It never lets me down, and I just love it because, like I said, the wicks burn evenly and it just starts off right away with an amazing smell. So I highly recommend it. Thank you for watching this review, and I will see you in the next video."

Happy Friday! I am going to talk to you guys today about the Capri Blue candles. I have talked about them briefly before in other candle videos because they are one of my all-time favorite candles. The brand just makes beautiful candles. The Volcano scent is one that you'll never forget. But before we get into that, I just want to let you guys know that I am here every Friday morning making a new video for you guys. So if you just subscribe and hit the bell, that will alert you when I'm going to be releasing a new video and when the video is live. Also, if you guys want to just hit the thumbs up, that will just let me know that you guys like this video or maybe you don't like this video, and then I know what content to be creating for you guys so that I'm not boring you and I'm giving you what you want. So let's talk about Capri Blue Volcano. First of all, Capri Blue is the brand, okay, and Volcano Number Six just happens to be their most popular scent. They are a soy-based wax that they use, and I'm going to show you. This is what their typical signature jar looks like, okay. It typically is all glass and it has just the one sticker here that says Volcano and then Number Six. Their wax is soy, but they do have a small amount of food-grade paraffin in their wax blend, and what this does is it allows for a longer burn time and it also allows for a more fragrant burn time. So this is a 19-ounce candle. That's pretty much their standard size, and it's one wick. This one I've been burning This blue looks just absolutely gorgeous when it's lit up. You need to get it a little bit further down before the jar starts to really light up, and you know the sun is behind me. You can see just how gorgeous this jar is. Yeah, so I mean Volcano is an obsession of mine. I even have the Volcano Capri Blue plug-in for my Pura, and I have a discount code for you guys for Pura if you're interested. It is amandamay15 Just put that code in when you're checking out and you guys will save 15% So just a side note. But this is the most delicious scent ever. I want to show you too, they say – I'll put an image up here for you guys from their website – but this is their signature jar, but they say that every closet needs a little black dress, and Capri Blue says that their signature candle needs to be in a black jar. Now I actually don't have one, surprisingly yet, but I'll put the image here and you guys can see that it looks just like this, but it's a black jar, and it's just supposed to be a timeless, classic-looking piece that is going to match any decor. So that is also kind of interesting, and now I think I need one. These candles retail for $30. You can get Capri Blue at capriblue.com, Nordstrom, Amazon, Anthropologie. I get a lot of mine at Anthropologie. And I just want to show you, when you buy them from Anthropologie, it will say on the jar \"Capri Blue for Anthropologie.\" Another one that I have is right here: Capri Blue Volcano for Anthropologie. So I don't think it says it on the top of this one, but it does say it on the lid. So you know, they always – that's how you know I guess where you get it from. In my other video, when I was talking about Capri Blue, I mentioned how it is a fruity, sugary, citrusy light smell, but it is definitely one that you can have burning all year long, which I do. I love it But I like that they change their jars So like this is one of the jars that I was talking about that just is like a really festive, beautiful jar, but it still has that same sugary, sweet citrus smell of the Volcano It is the Volcano, but it's just not in, you know, a pink, a blue, a black jar. This is the same one again in a nice pink jar. I like that for the holidays, they will put it in a jar like this. Like this looked really beautiful for like Thanksgiving or Christmas, just a little bit more festive. New Year's, you know what I mean? So I like that they spend the time on changing their glassware. They also have, around Christmas, they make like a red frosted glittery candle, which is so gorgeous for the holidays. I'm gonna show you this one. So this is Capri Blue, but this is their Spiced Cider scent. Look at this jar, you guys. So gorgeous, okay. Spiced Cider, this one is so beautiful. I have this already saved so that as soon as like the end of September, you know, the first official day of fall rolls around, this baby's gonna get lit, and I love it. Oh my god, it smells amazing, and it's just perfect for fall. And I just love how these burn. Burns straight down, if you guys can see that It's a beautiful, beautiful burn. The wax goes evenly all the way around. You don't end up with like a hole right in the middle. So I love it. Also, something else you should know about Capri Blue: they don't use any synthetic fibers for their wick. It's like a braided cotton wick, and it's gluten-free, vegan, paraben-free, sulfate-free, animal cruelty-free, which is huge. So I am just a huge lover of this candle company and specifically the scent Volcano. If you have not smelled it, maybe you have if you've been in an Anthropologie retail store. They sell so many of these that when you walk in, you get hit with this gorgeous smell, and it is the Volcano scent. And once you smell it, you will crave it and you will love it. And for $30 for this huge candle that just burns so beautifully, it is worth the money. And your house will always smell good, your room, and people will remember that beautiful scent because it is unique. So I am just definitely a fan of the Capri Blue. I'm going to link in the description box below for you guys where you can purchase them, the ones that I have, and just to make it easier for you. And if you have any questions at all about the candles, I'm your girl. I burn candles every single day all year long, even in the summer. I like this Volcano scent in the winter, in the summer, and the fall. I love it It is my staple. It's in my bedroom, it's in my living room, it's in my kitchen, it's in my bathroom. Like I said, I use the Pura plug-in. I just absolutely love it. It is such a gorgeous, refreshing, light scent that has a good throw and the jars and the packaging look gorgeous. So that is all for today. I hope that you guys found this helpful and that you found that you might be interested in a Capri Blue Volcano. It is definitely worth the money for a $30 candle. It's just a beautiful vessel and a great scent. So if you have any questions, let me know. Leave me a note in the comments, I will respond Follow me on Instagram, my name is Amanda J. May, and I'm also on Like to Know It, Amanda May And I will see you guys here next Friday for another video. I hope you have a great weekend."

I'm Capri Blue Volcano. I don't know what the six means, but I think this is the same candle that they burn in anthropology stores. 19 ounces Smells so good. Wish you all could smell this first burn, definitely most critical. Got to make sure it's all even and burn it for a few hours, or else you'll mess up, like I've done in the past and get an uneven candle burn. But yeah, first bird definitely most critical. Yeah, it's definitely one of my favorite candles of all time. So volcano blue, sorry, Capri blue, volcano, great Hope you have a great rest of your day, and please like and subscribe for more random unboxing videos. Thank you Bye You."

Happy Sunday So today I have a review for you of the Capri Blue Volcano candle. The size that I have right here is the 19-ounce size, and I actually purchased mine through Ulta. And, um, I was really excited when this candle finally came to Ulta because I have been wanting to purchase this for at least a few years, and I've always put it off because it's a little bit expensive as far as candles go. And obviously, with Capri Blue, the sales aren't as readily available as they are through, like, Bath and Body Works and Yankee Candle, and so I just never invested. However, when I saw that I could earn Ulta points, I went ahead and decided to pick it up when I placed my last Ulta order. Side note: I am honestly just shocked beyond belief that this candle, which is glass, like most candles are, arrived in one piece because it is not packaged in a box or bubble wrap or anything. It's available through several retailers, but with Ulta, they... I don't know what is wrong with their shipping department. I had this in a box with one other item, which was a mousse from Pureology. Basically, I am just shocked that this candle arrived in one piece and that I was actually able to burn it and enjoy it. Um, because like I said, like the lid, which is sitting right in here by the way, it was not even taped onto the candle in any kind of way. That was just floating around the box randomly because I'm sure that came off within moments of them actually putting the candle in the box. Um, but here it is It arrived in one piece. I've been burning it for a little over a week now, and I do in my downstairs bathroom. So that is where I'm recording this video, and I'm really glad I finally picked this candle up because everyone was definitely right about how amazing it smells. If you've ever been inside of an Anthropologie store, I believe that this is the fragrance that they sort of infused the entire store with is this volcano scent from Capri Blue. It is a very summery, very fresh citrusy type of fragrance. So I believe that the notes are tropical fruits and sugared citrus. Um, there really is no better way to explain it than like a tropical fruit punch mixed with a sugared citrus scent. It is very fresh, it's very clean, and it's like the perfect bathroom scent. And if you're looking for a citrus-type fragrance for a bathroom, it's a beautiful scent and I love it, and I am so glad that I finally tried it. I will absolutely be repurchasing it. I did take a look at the Capri Blue website, and they have different jar styles available in their fragrances. Volcano, I believe, is one of their most popular scents, but I've seen it in a pink jar. So very similar style to this one that you see but like an opaque pink. I've seen it in a, what do you call that, mercury glass type container. Slightly different style than this jar, but yes. So they have different options if you don't care for this blue one. You can definitely find it in some different packaging. I believe there's also like an opaque white. So for me, the blue is fine. I like blues, but the blue is the only one that's available through the Ulta website. By the way, I will link this down below for you so that you can go read up a little bit about it. So the 19-ounce jar retails for $30. I believe the prices are the same on the Capri Blue website. There's free shipping over a certain amount, I believe, but don't quote me on that. The only reason I haven't bought from their website is because, again, I like the Ulta, and I actually will have an Ulta haul coming up here where I included another one of these candles, and I got the entire haul for free because I used some of my many, many points. So yeah, I like getting it through there for that reason. But like I said, you can purchase at different places. As far as the strength and throw of this, um, that I am slightly disappointed in, but I'm not surprised because that is just kind of what I had heard about the candle to begin with. And that is that the strength in a small bathroom like here, it's like a strength of an 8.5 and a throw of, I don't know, I mean it fills this bathroom It travels slightly outside of the bathroom into our entryway, but really not much. So this is kind of a one-room candle in my eyes. When I put this in my kitchen and family room, which is more of an open concept area, I could get a faint whiff of the fragrance, which is nice. I mean it doesn't have to slap you in the face, but I really like stronger candles. That being said, for me, this is the perfect bathroom scent. I did also buy the volcano hand wash through the Ulta website, so I'm gonna have that in the bathroom here. So I think I'm just gonna have this as my permanent bathroom candle, especially for the spring and summer. I'll probably switch it up for fall and winter, but it is a beautiful scent, you guys. Um, it's just not a great performer in an open concept type area. I'm gonna stick with my Homeworx candles and, you know, obviously my Bath & Body Works backups and anything that I buy coming up from them. But yeah, just strength isn't there. As far as burn performance, that's another thing that I wanted to talk about. I'm just gonna, sorry I knocked the camera here, I'm just gonna move you up over here so that you can see that this bad boy wants to tunnel And that was another thing that I knew was going to happen because everybody says that it does. Believe me, I let this burn all the way to the outer edge and it had a really nice wax pool the first burn. And with most candles, if you do that, they will burn perfectly the whole way down. This one does not In subsequent burns, even if I try to let it pull out completely for like five hours, it just won't do it. So yeah, I've had to rate the leg burn performance on this I probably put that at like a three or a four because one, it takes forever to pull out. So this is not something that you want to like just on a whim. You need at least four hours to get it to pull out at least mostly And it's not a producer, but it's funny, when I stick my nose right over the candle, it has a slight burnt scent to it. And I'm not just burning my nose hairs, it just smells different than when I take like three steps away. When I'm not sniffing it right up close, when it's burning, it smells fantastic. But when I stick my nose in it, it just has this odd scent change and I don't know why. And that combined with that tunneling out, it's just not a great burn performance, if that makes sense. However, again, that being said, even with all of that, the fragrance of this is so wonderful in and of itself that I'm totally willing to deal with it and I'll just kind of work with the candle. I imagine when I get to the last, you know, maybe third of it, I'll just pop it into my candle crock, which will be fine. But yeah, so I don't know. I kind of have mixed feelings about this I will definitely keep purchasing it, but I do wish that the burn on it was better and that the throwing strength were a little bit better because it is such a lovely scent. That being said, just because those two things are not there, it's not going to scare me away from continuing to repurchase the candle. It's a little bit more high maintenance, but that's okay. By the way, I did not trim my wicks on the first burn and on subsequent burns I just went ahead and took off that little mushroom top and I did not cut the wick too short because really there wasn't a lot of wick there after the first burn. So I don't know if that has anything to do with it. This is my first Capri Blue candle, so let me know if you have a little bit more experience with these guys because I'm curious. I mean, I don't think I did anything wrong, but maybe, you know, let me know what your experience is with these candles and if you have any tips or tricks to get the throw to improve or, you know, maybe should I put it in a hurricane or something? Let me know I would love to hear your feedback. Thank you so much for taking the time to watch. I have some more Homework candles that I am burning to report back on from the spring and summer line. I know I am late, I have been so late in getting those out. The Homeworx Christmas in July is coming up on the 15th, I believe. So keep your eyes out for that. There will be a today's special value and some preview of the fall items. And yeah, so thank you guys so much for taking the time to watch. Let me know if you have any questions, and I'll see you in my next video. Take care. Bye."

This is interesting. Oh yeah, okay, so it comes in this box. It's got a little carton. [Laughter] Oh, that's cool. That's really nice. Yeah, wow. Wow, this is a fancy candle. Chesapeake Bay Candle I can smell it from here already Really nice Yeah I love how it has this, I didn't know it had a little. Let me see if I can take it off here. Oh yeah Mmm, that's really nice. Wow Very nice Beautiful Chesapeake Bay Mind and Body Balance and Harmony Water Lily Pear So I took a chance on this one. I didn't know what it smelled like before I bought it because when you buy candles online you can't really smell them. But it had really good reviews and it was the one that was recommended to me by Amazon. It's the one that showed up. I typed in something like, um, candles or just candle and this wasn't the top hit but it was one of the big ones And it's a soy wax blend, so that's why, that was one of the reasons I bought this. I did a lot of research on candles and I decided that I either wanted to get soy wax, palm wax, or beeswax. I was shopping for one of those three. I didn't want anything else. I spent a lot of time doing research and I figured that one of those three would be the best for me. Oh, it smells amazing. So let's go ahead and light it. There are no spelling mistakes in the text. Look at the size of it. It is a little bit smaller than I thought. I think, looking at the pictures on Amazon, I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger, but I'm kind of happy that it's not bigger. I think it's a good size. Like, it fits in my fist This is really nice. Mmm, it smells so good. That's shockingly good. It smells better than pretty much every candle I remember smelling at a store. Okay, it's lit. Oh yeah Look at that Beautiful What a nice candle. I bought some more candles too. I ordered a bunch of candles. This is just one of the candles that I ordered. Um, this is the nicest candle I ordered. I also ordered a multi-pack of candles that I haven't opened yet. I think those are unscented, but I wanted to get one nice candle to start because I'm going to start collecting candles for something that I'm doing. And I'm going to be having lots of candles here in my office, hopefully So this is probably the first of many candles that I purchase. And so, soy wax blend, that's what did it for me. Amazon recommended it I think it smells great. It's supposed to burn very slow. Yeah, really, really nice. Really beautiful candle I like it a lot I'm very happy with my purchase. I hope this video has been helpful. Good luck."
8;"Scented Candles";"Chesapeake Bay Candle";26;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nA1qUKmw9U&pp=ygUVQ2hlc2FwZWFrZSBCYXkgQ2FuZGxl";"Hi everyone, and welcome back to another Jazzy Wix Candle review. So today I am reviewing another Chesapeake Bay candle for you. You might have watched my previous review; I literally filmed it just before this one but spread out the reviews on my channel, so hence why I look exactly the same. I'm filming them one after the other. I've just reviewed Lemongrass and Eucalyptus, which I'll link down below just in case you haven't watched it. But I am now reviewing Strength and Energy Pineapple and Coconut So this again was £7.99, the same as the previous one, and I got it in the sale for £6.39. It's not much of a big deal but a little bit of a discount there. It's 96 grams, and just for anyone that didn't watch the last video, just in case you don't want to go back and watch it, Chesapeake Bay Candle and Yankee Candle are now owned by parent company Newell Brands. Excuse me for looking down; I can't remember all that off the top of my head, I'm reading it off my iPad. So they announced the decision in 2019 to consolidate under one roof. Basically, Chesapeake Bay Candles are 100% non-toxic, made from high-quality oils and soy wax. It looks like they all consolidate under one roof of the New Jersey Corporation Home Fragrance Division. When you go on the UK Yankee Candle website, you've got Woodwick Candle at the top, Yankee Candle, and now you've got Chesapeake Bay. This is a new addition. I did see them online; I wasn't too bothered about trying them, but then I went to the store, and they were in there, so I gave some of them a cold sniff and thought, why not get a couple of small ones since they were on offer. So I managed to get a couple for around £13. Why not give them a go? Someone's got to review them. Let me have a look at the scent notes for this one. So, before I get onto the scent notes, this is also at the moment of filming the fragrance of the season, so it's got 25% off. This comes in a medium candle, a small candle, and a large candle. It also comes in a large three-wick candle. Let me just click on the small one here. This one's actually £5.99 on the website at the moment of filming, and I paid £6.39 for it, but I don't know if that is just an in-store offer. I don't know if that was a fragrance of the season offer. We have top notes of verbena, bergamot, grapefruit, and mango, with mid notes of pineapple, coconut, ozone, and melon, with base notes of orange blossom, amber, musk, and vanilla. This beauty, I really, really liked. Unfortunately, this one just didn't perform quite as well. It was a little bit more on the weak side. It was not as strong as the one that I had already reviewed – I keep forgetting what that one's called – Lemongrass and Eucalyptus This one wasn't quite as strong. The main notes that I got through on this one were definitely the pineapple and the coconut. I feel like my lights just got brighter. That's strange. I don't know if it's because the sun's gone in. Iggnore me So, pineapple and coconut, maybe a little bit of vanilla, a little bit of the musk, but it was just very, very weak compared to the other one. I would say for a throw rating, probably looking at maybe five, maybe four. The other one filled this whole room that I'm in, and the door was open, and I walked up to it, and I could smell it straight away. This one just wasn't as strong. I had to be basically hanging over it to really get a decent smell of it. You could definitely smell that there was something there. There was definitely the pineapple and the coconut; it was just so, so weak. So unfortunately for me, one good one, one bad one for the experiences at the moment. This one I personally wouldn't recommend, whereas the Lemongrass Eucalyptus I would. But yeah, this one, I'm probably gonna go with a four out of ten. I think even that's still being generous because it was very, very weak. I'm still interested in trying some others. I would maybe like to try the larger-sized jars, but yeah, for me, I've had one good one, I've had one bad one. But you can't win them all. Some Yankee Candles are awful, some are great. Same as Woodwicks, same as any brand Sometimes you do get a bad one. But yeah, for me, Pineapple Coconut was a bit of a dud, not one that I'll be getting again. It was just far too weak. I feel like coconut can be quite a strong scent as well, but on this occasion, this one, not for me. Wasn't strong enough, didn't fill the room. It performed nicely, like it didn't tunnel, small mushroom on the top, no soot, but yeah, just for the scent side of it, unfortunately, it just wasn't strong enough So not one that I'd recommend. If you have any Chesapeake Bay scents that you think I should try, then let me know. But as always, thank you for watching, and I'll get a new review out for you soon."

If you guys do not know this about me, if you're a new subscriber or if you're an old subscriber, you might already know what I'm talking about. I am very, very obsessed with candles and I do a lot of hauls from Bath & Body Works, candles, and stuff like that. I am planning to do a huge candle haul probably next week. We're going to talk about the company a little bit. Chesapeake Bay candles are a very well-known candle brand. They're sold at Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Kohl's. So they are very well known. I purchased a couple of candles from this brand and my all-time favorite one is Orchid Guava. I repurchased that candle multiple times because I just love the scent of that candle. Not only can you find them in stores, but you can also find them online, so I'll link them down below. The candles I'm going to be reviewing for you guys today are their Holiday Collection, so I think these are perfect for Christmas gift ideas and I hope you guys enjoy this review. Alright, so the first candle we're going to talk about is Spiced Berry. It looks like this. The packaging is amazing. You can give this as a gift like this already; you don't even have to wrap it because it comes with the bow. It looks like this and the candle is in here. It's just amazing packaging. I love it Super cute and festive And this smells amazing. My mom and I love this scent. This is one of our favorites out of all the candles I'm going to be showing you guys. If you could smell this through the computer, you guys would love this too. It smells just like Christmas. I just freaking love it. If you go by any of the stores that I mentioned and just stop by and smell, you guys will love it. So they describe this scent as luscious berries shimmering with seasonal spices of cinnamon and crushed nutmeg over energizing orange, crisp apple, and a welcoming hint of warm vanilla. This is like Christmas in a candle. It just smells so good. Okay, so the candle itself looks like this and it's just like a frosty, glossy silver container. It just says the name of the candle right here. Open the candle, it has a little cover right here so it won't ruin the wick, and it looks like this. This smells so good. Alright, so my mom asked me not to burn this candle until Christmas because she just loves the scent so much and it just gives like a warm, Christmassy aroma. So I really like this candle. If you guys want to have a nice Christmas scented candle, definitely check this one out. Alright, so the next candle is called Falling Snow. It looks like this. It's like a blue and silver packaging. Super cute, like I said. The scent is described as cheerful yet pristine, sparkling citrus and crisp green notes dance over snow-dusted furs as hints of frosted mint and cool vanilla complete this clean combination. Like a child at the sight of a snowball, excitement glitters in the air. So when you open it, it looks like this. Like I said, it has a glossy silver finish on the container and the name of the candle right here. It definitely reminds me of peppermint and just like a fresh, crisp winter day. So if you guys like minty candle scents, this is the one for you. Definitely check this one out. The next candle I'm going to be talking about is called Frosted Evergreen. This one is described as a holiday mistletoe berry with frosted musk. This one smells just like a fresh tree that you would get for Christmas. It smells so good. I'm actually burning this one right now in my living room. It looks like this. It's the same design with the frosted glass and just the picture on it. It smells so amazing. So if you like that kind of scent, definitely check this one out. I don't want to burn myself right now. Alright, so the big candles retail for $20 and I feel like it's very reasonable because it's the same price as Bath & Body Works three-wick candles, and these have cute packaging. You can get them and they're ready to go because of the cute bows and stuff like that. They smell amazing. They have a very long burning time. So I'd say if you guys don't want to commit to buying one huge candle, you can buy the mini version of all three holiday scents. This is a perfect gift. Also, you can give this to one person or gift it to three people and just give them one of each. They smell really, really good. If you guys aren't into candles and just want to test out these candles to see if you want to buy the full size, you can do that. This is so cute, like they're just so adorable and mini. I love mini anything, so this is really cute to me. Alright, thanks for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed my review. If you guys are candle lovers like I am, you're probably like, \"She's so excited talking about candles.\" Why does she like candles so much? To me, I think it's so relaxing. I love the aroma. It just smells good. I do like candles throughout the whole year. Even if it's summer and spring and it's hot outside, I do like candles all year round. I love all seasonal scents, just the fruity scent. I love any type of candle. I gifted my whole family Christmas candles and they all loved them. I got my boyfriend into candles, my dad, my mom. My mom buys her own candles without me knowing. She puts them in the bathroom, the kitchen, the living room, and it just gives ideas and they smell awesome. Who wouldn't appreciate a candle? I feel like I'm a grandma for loving candles, but everyone has something they're obsessed with and I am obsessed with candles. So I hope you enjoyed my review and see you guys in my next video. Bye, guys."

This is a 14.5 oz 3-wick candle. You get this really nice gold-colored top paired with like a salmon-colored frosted glass jar. The label in the front has some texture on it. There is no label in the back. Underneath, you can find some candle safety information. My initial impression was a sweet berry aroma; that's very nice. Later in the day, I tried for the champagne, and I finally found that champagne aroma. The label says champagne, berries, and tangerine. I'm a huge fan of 3-wick candles because they release more aroma. Bath and Body Works are my favorite types of candles to buy, and this one did not disappoint. If you're into a berry and light champagne fragrance, check this one out."

I'm back again, back again with another lit candle review. Okay, y'all, this one is from White Barn, from the infamous, often imitated, never duplicated, what? Champagne Toast Look at the packaging. I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that request. Look, look, look, look, look How pretty is this in its simplicity? It's absolutely gorgeous. I don't know what it is about it, but it's like a rainbow. And yeah, I got the same night, y'all know I told you I only got a couple It is what it is I'm clean now, all right. Shane: Ain't nobody worried about that Ain't nobody got time for that Okay, alright y'all So for those of you who've seen the last video mentioning this candle, yeah y'all And for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, I think that Goose Creek may have used this candle as inspiration for their Champagne Sparkle, aka Champagne Balls. Yeah, that was shady They bathed us. Yeah, they repackaged something. I don't understand why people do that. That's like, okay, I'm not even trying to be funny. That's like me putting on a different outfit and calling myself Bethany. Huh? It's the same. Alright, come on, focus. Alright, I'm just annoyed. We know, we know, we know. Alright, okay, so Champagne Toast, this packaging, it's probably not available anymore. I got this back in 2019, I believe. I have another one in the closet. They don't care. Okay, let me tell you a little history about Champagne Toast and me. First time I smelled it, it was so potent that I had to take it downstairs. But it was okay being downstairs because that's when I used to work downstairs when I had my little home office downstairs. But I kind of moved it up here. Shane: I don't care. I don't care. Just make, make a point Oh, the point is it's potent Alright, so I may have to move it downstairs in the midst of it all. Okay, thank you. Alright, I could pull it together when I want to. Alright, so let's look at the wax which I know is white wax with, I'm saying chicken legs, I'm calling it Who, who, who putting in with me? Is that how y'all do when you roll dice and stuff? I don't know how to do that. Never rolled a die a day in my life You play Monopoly. Okay, here we go, y'all should have bet me. Well then, you would have wanted Oh, okay. Yeah, we got white wax and chicken, chili chicken Yeah, stupid. I didn't smell it by taking the top off. What is going on? Oh, oh, oh, since I stopped burning the other candle, I'm going to smell it. Okay, let's see. It's different. It's different when cold, I promise you. It did this, this it y'all. My wish right. Yeah, this one is more potent. Okay, anyway, so, uh, uh, uh, um, the notes How about that? We got bubbly champagne, we got sparkling berries, juicy tangerine, essential oils Okay, so let me trim light and get this puppy started, y'all. And I will be back and we will get to the bottom of this. Alright, stay tuned. Y'all, I don't know what's going on but the throw on this Champagne Toast, it's weak. It's weak, it's weak. Is that crossed out? It's weak. I don't even hardly smell it, y'all, and it's been going for like two, three hours. What the, what's going on? Don't know, y'all These might have to go back in the bowl. I'm just saying, I'm just saying And I got two of these Yeah, um, I don't know, maybe I should put on the warmer. This week, it's the weakest week, it's like a five Now, the one I had before, that was a ten for me that I had to take downstairs. Shane: Shut up, was in a different packaging Are you me? Alright, alright. Alright, let me get back to, um, throwing away some of these old clothes. Yeah, I'm working today, Sunday, and I'm trying to declutter. It's not a clutter, Shane, because it's upstairs in the crawl space. Shane: Shut up. See, she's an enabler. No, but for me, I got too much old clothes I haven't worn in years. 

Correction: No, but for me, I have too many old clothes I haven't worn in years. I gotta get rid of it. I got to, I got to, I got to So, alright, alright, I can't waste no more time with y'all. Let me get to it, but I'm appalled. Stay tuned Hey, hey, how you doing? Alright y'all, so it's late, it's hours later, and um, I don't blue shield, let her recall, re-lit her, turns on the warmer, not the lamp. She's on the warmer while she's burning and she moved from a five to a six Yeah, um, Champagne Sparkle, aka Champagne Bubbles from Goose to the Creek, used Bath and Body Works Champagne Toast as inspiration. What? Y'all know what I mean. Different outfits, but yeah, is, you know, I say so, right? This might be controversial, but I'm gonna say it anyway. Um, there's no patent in a candle scent, right? None that I know about. So if a company is inspired by a scent from another company, it's an inspiration, right? Some, somebody says, but I'm gonna say inspiration. We know, but if that company takes said candle, puts it in a different outfit and calls it something else, that's a dupe. To me, to me Yeah, so having said all that, performance wise, other than the weak ass throw, this is a nice looking, performing candle, y'all. I have another one, but she's going back in the bowl. I don't need two of this week, point-blank period. I don't I would rather have, I'm gonna say it, Champagne Sparkle, goodness Now, the Champagne Toast I have from before was a powerhouse. I don't know what they did differently, but whatever they did, they need to undo it. Alright, anyhow, yeah, she's so pretty though. She's so pretty. But yeah, she's weak. Um, and who, maybe it's my, um, pH balance. Um, let me know if y'all had this exact one, not the one from before What, not a different packaging, this packaging, and tell me what your throw is I'm very curious. Maybe I should tell you how to, um, what is the SKU on the back? What is it called? I don't know what it is, but right now she's hot so I can't tell y'all. Maybe if I remember, I'll put it in the description box below. And, um, because whatever this, huh, alright, wrap it up, okay So, anyhow, having said all of that, I will see you later. I love your guts and be good Alright, come on, you can do it."

Today we're going to be going over my top scents from Bath and Body Works, the best-smelling candles in my opinion from Bath and Body Works. But before we get started, go ahead and hit that like button, go ahead and subscribe to our channel if you already haven't, and if you're new, welcome. So before we actually get into the smells and the scents of each of these candles here, I want to give you guys a brief story about how long I've been rocking with candles. And if you're not already onto the candles, then what are you doing? You're tripping. So back in 2014, that's when I bought myself a candle, a housewarming gift which was my all-time favorite smell to this day. I'm gonna rock with her until they discontinue it That is A Thousand Wishes Of course, when I was in the dorm first semester of my freshman year, we were not able to have candles. It's clearly a hazard or a fire; you can't have anything that can cause a fire. When I moved off campus, trying to find things for the house, and I went into Bath & Body Works, and this was, I think, around Christmas time. They came out with A Thousand Wishes, and that's been my favorite since I'm gonna go ahead and get started. A Thousand Wishes is like a bunch of wishes, a thousand wishes coming true. This scent here is just so nice, so sweet, so lovely. It's just a happy smell. The packaging of this candle is so pretty. I really, really love this candle. It's giving good vibes. But what's in this candle here is pink prosecco, sparkling quince, crystal peonies, gilded amber, amaretto cream with essential oils. I smell everything that is just listed in this candle. It's literally my all-time favorite candle. Back in December, I did Secret Santa at my job, and this was the scent that I put down on my paper that I love. And then again, if I had you as a Secret Santa... which was crazy, my Secret Santa, we had each other So I gifted her with the candle, and I was actually asking for a candle when I asked him, but I put that on my list of one of the things that I love and one of the wishes that I want. And she actually said they didn't have any candles, which they never do. They don't have these in stores; you have to order this one. But she gifted me with the body scrub, the body cream, and I think the body wash of this scent. If you guys really want to gift anyone with a candle, I would say A Thousand Wishes. It's just the perfect smell. And I'm gonna list all these down here. Speaking of though, Bath & Body Works' sale is still going on today. I'm not sure how long, but the single-wick candles are five dollars. So maybe y'all could even, out of all of these candles, just get the single-wick candles. They're five dollars. Try it out I promise you, you're gonna upgrade to three-wick candles because they're that good. I promise So yes, A Thousand Wishes, that smells amazing. Our next candle we're gonna go with is Bergamot Waters. Bergamot Waters is maybe like.. All of these, one, two, three, are ten. Period. That smell, oh my gosh. I know I'm dramatic, just a little bit, but I'm telling y'all it doesn't really smell that good. This is one of the... This is the clean-smelling, just like... Oh, this is the candle that I would burn all day. You can't even burn candles for over four hours, but this candle, I will literally burn it all day because it's just the cleanest smell, the prettiest smell, the nicest smell, the softest smell. By the way, none of these candles are too harsh. None of them are like really, really strong to where it causes you to get a headache. It's not like that, none of these I mean, maybe just one, which is... What we're gonna find out later. But this one here, your house better be clean if you're burning this one, like really This one here is the bright bergamot, sugared citrus. Nothing says sugar Sugared citrus, sandalwood, it smells really good. The packaging was cute. I like this nice simple color. This is the candle you can get a male or female because it's just a clean scent. It's a very, very fresh scent. Like again, if I told y'all you can burn candles, well you're not supposed to burn candles over four hours, but this is something I would probably literally burn all 24 hours just because it's just that good It's the candle you can fall asleep on, you can just be happy with this scent. Like seriously, this is a happy, happy, happy, happy scent. So yeah, that is Bergamot Waters. My next favorite candle is Cactus Blossom. Amazing too. Again, like those three are amazing. This one, this is the one that I have in my car, like the little car jars from Bath & Body Works. This is a nice strong sweet flowery, like it's fruity too, a pretty smell, a nice smell It's like a cactus blossoming. This one actually did. That's it, I hope I told y'all what was it. Bergamot Waters, I think I did But this one here is cactus flower petals. Yep, I said it's like a flower smell. What do, we got this, that's a plant That's most definitely a plant. But this one here is the cactus flower petals, fresh citrus Yup, fruity vanilla coconut You do smell the vanilla. It's like a fruity and vanilla This one smells really, really good, and this is also a candle I would gift. Those top three, these top three that I just said, were the other two, and then this one is a candle that you should gift. Or if you're just a candle fan, you should already know about them three, like again But this one is so, so, so, so, so good. Y'all know how certain smells bring memories? It just brings me good memories, of course, because I always burn this one too So like it's springing, it's freaking good memories. This is a lovely smell. Just know that this is also a lovely smell. So yes, let me go ahead and hurry up because shortly I need to go pick up Izzy from school. So next, I'm going to go with Mahogany Teakwood. Mahogany Teakwood is a male and female candle. This one here, I also used to buy this one in college. A Thousand Wishes and this one were my two I used to always switch out or not switch out, but you know, well yeah, switch out in my apartment, burn which candle This one gives... Honestly, my friend, it's really a groan sexy Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I just know females that actually like the smell of men, like the good smell with the cologne But I know females that actually like that smell. And then men, of course, they're gonna like this candle. This is the candle that I actually get the men in the family who are candle fans, who like candles. I want to say candle fans because men don't really care But this is a candle that I would gift to men and females. It depends on, honestly, it depends on the person, like if they like fruity stuff, if they like that sexy stuff, because this is what it's giving, a grown sexy man This one has rich mahogany, dark oak, frosted lavender. I smell the lavender. I do smell the lavender Oh yeah, rich mahogany, dark oak. Yeah, it's definitely giving some type of mood It's a teakwood, mahogany, teakwood. And this one, I like this one in the Mahogany Teakwood High Intensity. It's just high intensity, it's way stronger than this one. And I like, you know, things that are not going to give me so much of a headache. So I feel like this one's just as strong. So they smell the same to me. Clearly, it's the same thing, but just high intensity. But this one is really, really good. And I like the dark charcoal grey type of colour. Let's go. I like the plain packaging more than the designed ones because it just goes nicely with the decor sometimes. So yeah, that is Mahogany Teakwood, a really, really good male and female scent. The next one I'm gonna go with is Rose Water and Ivy. Rose Water and Ivy, this is also a nice feminine scent. Clearly, it's definitely giving the roses. You smell the roses. And I thought roses really don't smell like nothing, but this is giving flowers, it's giving roses The roses and ivy, and it's like... I like to smell it and guess the scents before I actually see what's in those candles. Okay, I never really pay attention to what's in it, I just always buy it, get used to how it smells, and then just keep buying them. And that's the reason why I only get these ones because nine times out of ten, I'm always ordering the candles instead of going in the store. I just don't like all that extra stuff. Yeah, I really wouldn't even know what other candles, what other candles to get because I don't want to order a candle and it smells bad. Even though I could go switch it out, I just don't. Again, got time for all of that. My time is precious. This one is soft rose petals, which, yep, definitely smell like rose petals. English ivy, yeah, whatever ivy smells like, I guess. This is lemon blossom. Lemon blossom, I don't know I mean, I think I need some coffee beans at this point to loosen up my senses, let me loosen up my nose some But um, I don't know. Wait, wait, wait, wait I'm trying to see if I smell the lemon. By me thinking of a lemon and smelling at the same time, I feel like I just smelled it when I pulled it away from my nose. So let me try it again. You do smell it. Yep, you smell it. You smell exactly what it says. All of the candles, you smell exactly what they say I mean, you're supposed to, which is funny But yes But I feel like the roses are definitely overpowering the lemon. That's why it's called Rose Water and Ivy The next one is... I'm gonna leave the aromatherapies for last. Champagne Toast Champagne Toast, I never burned I actually just ordered this one when I ordered all of these. I was always hearing about Champagne Toast, so I'm like, you know, let me just go ahead and be open to trying new smells, new scents, and see what this is all about. Champagne Toast I like the name. It smells fruity. This smells really fruity to me. I feel like this smells like a springy candle, a spring candle because it smells fruity. It's a nice fruity smell. So this is like something I'll probably burn on a Saturday morning, open up the blinds, and just go with the vibes. That's what this one is. And what's in this one? What's in this one? Yep This one is bubbly champagne, sparkling berries, fruit, sweet orange fruit. Yep, I knew it. With natural oils So yep, this is definitely fruity, but it smells really good though. And I actually like that I finally tried a few, well one new candle. And there's other candles that I also tried that just not listed as my top favorite yet because I do like Tiki Beach. And Tiki Beach, I think that one's very, very fruity too. Tiki Beach is a nice fruity smell too. I had those in the wallflower plugs, like the refills, the wallflowers. I have Cactus Blossom. I used to do Sweet Pea I still do Sweet Pea here and there, it depends. I put the Sweet Pea one in Izzy's room though. It's not too strong, it's not too much, and that's just like a Sweet Pea, like Izzy is a sweet little pea. Joke, my baby is a sweet pea But I put that smell in her room just because it's like a nice kid-friendly smell. So it's sweet and it's just like her. That smell reminds me of her. How about that? I like the way that sounds better. So yeah, but Champagne Toast is really good. Oh, what was I saying? Cactus Blossom, I have that in the wallflower, the Tiki Beach, Sweet Pea, Bergamot Waters I have that one. A Thousand Wishes, duh And yeah, those are the only scents that I have. I actually need to re-up. Speaking of wallflowers, they're $3.50, not $3.50, $4.50 today too. So y'all, when I'm done with this video, make sure y'all just go ahead and go to Bath & Body Works, order some things, or yeah, just do that. But this is also a good-smelling candle. Now, down to the aromatherapy ones. I like. Oh yeah, by the way, I burned the candles from least to greatest. So my top three are really the ones I burned last. For these two, I'm going to say which one I burned first, which is this one. You can already see I've been burning this one. I burn this one all the time. And this one is the Stress Relief. This one, I burn all day. Again, I burn when I'm working from home, I burn it when I'm about to take a bubble bath, I burn it when I'm about to do yoga, when I'm reading my books I burn it when I want to go to sleep. Like these two, I burn the aromatherapy ones literally for that. This one is Stress Relief. This one is literally what it is, stress relief. I said stress-free, but stress relief, that's what this one is. I used to also have these two in the, what is it, the body creams because they're like a nice massaging, that nice massaging lotion, a body cream It's also a clean smell too. This one is eucalyptus and spearmint. You definitely smell, you definitely smell the mint This one opens you up because of the mint. Eucalyptus, I'm not really sure. I mean, it smells what it is. It's a plant, earthy, and like a, I feel like it's definitely a clean smell. I just felt like I smelled some type of soap. Yeah, it's giving a soapy smell too. I'm not sure what smell I'm smelling though. Get this, especially like if I gifted someone with stress relief when I know certain situations For instance, the ones who like to do hookah, chill out, smoke with some wine, this will go perfect with the way that they release their stress. So that's why if you've got somebody that's always stressed out or got a stressful job or stressful whatever, this one is a good one. And this is also a good smell to have around the house too because it's a clean smell. Again, it's a nice strong smell, and I'm starting to get a headache. So this is the candle I was trying to tell y'all. Now, I probably don't have a headache because of this candle, but I have a headache if I was to smell all of these candles. And it's time for me to eat, but this is the candle that actually is, it's strong for sure You'll smell this miles away, but it's supposed to do that. It's supposed to open you up. It's meant It's eucalyptus. That stuff there, it really opens you up. So yeah, it's supposed to be strong and it's just the perfect scent. Again, for when you meditate, when you read, when you do yoga, when you do bubble baths, when you just... These are what I call my self-care candles. This is a self-care candle. And I can close you up now because yeah, we're done with you, eucalyptus stress relief candle. And our last candle, which was also a gift given to me, and that's what got me onto this one. This one is the Comfort Aromatherapy one. This one is vanilla and, I think it's called patchouli, patchouli, patchouli, put something That's what this is. This one is a nice happy. Oh, it's giving comfort for real. Like, that's a nice clean, soft, relaxing, Thanksgiving, let's go get some massages and just relax. This one has sweet vanilla. Definitely smell the vanilla Patchouli, I think that's a flower. I think it is a flower or yeah, something that I saw. Italian bergamot They smell the same. Bergamot for sure. Well, it doesn't smell exactly the same, but this one, yeah, both smells soft and clean. I do that again. I break my goddamn candles Let me just put you back. But they smell the same, have similar smells, which is the bergamot because that's what this has too And cedarwood Oh, that's it with the essential oils. This one again is very nice, soft, clean, comfortable. I will also burn this one while I'm going to sleep. Same thing that I get, told you guys about the stress relief These are my self-care candles. This is what I do when it's time for me to do some self-care. I just burned that one more I just burn that one first because that one's more strong. And I like this one over stress relief. But yeah, I will also gift somebody with this for the same reasons as stress relief. But these are really, really good smells, and that is the Comfort Vanilla and Patchouli or Patchouli or whatever it is. Okay, that's the stress relief. This one has eucalyptus oil, clears the mind. I didn't have to print this bucket because it's literally the same thing, eucalyptus and spearmint. That's exactly what's in here. And that soothes and uplifts This, they both soothe, but yeah, that is my top. One, two, I'm not gonna count you because I don't know you just yet, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Seven, that's a good number. But that is my top seven scents, my always, my go-tos. I always, always, always re-up on those candles. I literally have two to three each already. But those are my top seven scents, even Champagne Toast. That's going to be the eighth one because I actually like that smell. It's a nice sweet fruity, springy smell. So I guess we could be nice to add her over here too. Thank you guys for watching. Make sure you stay tuned for our next video. Make sure you like, comment, subscribe. If you want more videos like this, go ahead and comment below and say yes, keep going. I would be open to trying new scents and actually doing reviews on candles. But again, I love candles. So if you ever see me and want to be nice, just think... Just think if you ever go to Bath & Body Works, just think about me too. Thank you guys for watching. I need to go pick up my baby now and yeah, thank you."

Today we're going to be doing something random, but it's going to be fun for me, and what's fun for me is probably fun for you. And if it's not, I mean subscribe anyway. In this video, I'm going to be opening some candles. And there's like very specific channels that I can and cannot really deal with. The ones that are made out of desserts are usually disgustingly sweet, and the ones that are like, they just smell like earth, literally just smell like earth. Candles are really hard to come by that I can appreciate My favorite candle by far is, I think it's a little bit, a Yankee Candle or some other type of brand, but it's Black Bamboo. It's so subtle but at the same time pungent. It lasts so long and it's good. But that's not what this is about. This is about a new random candle that I found that I enjoy so much. I'm actually not sure what the brand of.. Oh yes I am, it's called Lulu Candle. And in this video, I have two to open and smell, and then tell you how it smells. So I have experience with Lulu candles before. I previously bought two other candles from them and then I decided since I'm buying two more, that means I enjoy them and that needs to be told to you. So one of the first candles I bought is the Jasmine Oud and Sandalwood. It smells so good to the point where you can just open the box, you just sit it on your table and the room will smell like this very subtly but very, very impressive. It smells like if the guy in your office that you're crushing on for about two years and right before you left the company came up to you was like, “I always liked you, you're beautiful, would you like to go on a date?” This is what this smells like So we're gonna figure out what these smell like. I usually lean toward those woody, no pun intended, earthy type smells that don't smell like soil but smell like plants or freshness like baby powder or cotton or linen, if you will. So with these new ones, I'm trying something different. So let's open it and see what we got. Okay, you can already smell.. Oh yeah, it's not the friend again. As you can see, these are soy candles. The only fun fact I know about soy candles is if you use it for anything other than the scent, it won't cause any severe burns. Don't quote me, I'm not a doctor. I'm also not a professional BDSM-er, but I do enjoy it anyway. This one is vanilla. Oh, it's number 43, 100% cotton wick, slow burning, 255 grams, nine ounces, hand-poured in the USA by Lulu candles. This one smells like if you're sitting in church and the old lady next to you is like, “Do you want a hard candy?” You get that hard candy and you put it in your mouth and you're like, “Wow, this is probably the best thing ever,” and then they end church quickly This is what this smells like. This is like if you went camping and your friends were like, “Just kidding, you don't want to go camping,” and then turned around and said, “We're actually going to Puerto Rico,” and you guys drink coquito all day. This is what this smells like. So let’s open the other one. It's so random. Whoa, this one smells fresh. Okay, this is why. This one is Lilac and Violet, number 62, slow-burning, of course, 100% cotton, 160 grams, not nine ounces. I'm sorry, how is that possible? No, someone tell me why I'm confused. This is so weird. But anyway, this smells like if you were to get out of a shower and then roll around in a field of roses and then go to the hospital because it smells so darn clean there, they give you free healthcare and tell you you have no problems This is what this smells like. If you went on vacation and you landed on a beach because gravity, and you got onto the sand, you got into the water, you had yourself a good time, you walked back to the sand and you weren't covered in it. Together though, it smells like you went to a party, you had too much to drink, you threw up, you felt so much better, you went home, got in bed, woke up without a hangover, met your friends for brunch, you had a mimosa and some French toast with whipped cream on it. It has a good... No spelling mistakes found. That's what this smells like. I gotta stop misspelling things If you guys like this, please give me a thumbs up.

Welcome back to my channel. Happy Friday! Today I'm going to be sharing with you guys a new candle company that I have discovered because one of my best friends sent me several for my birthday in February as a gift. I had never heard of this brand of candles and I was so pleasantly surprised and actually like obsessed, obsessed with them. She sent me an assortment and I ended up repurchasing one of them two times and I've also gifted them to one of my other girlfriends whose birthday was in February. I have shared and shared and shared these candles with everyone because I love the packaging and I love the scent and the throw and I love the price. So, before we get in, welcome back to my channel. I post a new video here every Friday morning at 7 a.m. Eastern Standard Time and it is usually a luxury unboxing, a beauty item, a scent fragrance candle, etc., something I love So if there's any questions about anything that I talk about, you guys can definitely ask me in the comment section below and I'll be sure to answer. And if you have any suggestions and things that you want to see, definitely make sure that you also reach out. I want to talk about Lulu Candles. Okay, oh my god. First of all, look at the simplicity of this packaging. I mean, there's nothing better than this I love the simplicity. I love that it's just like a plain vessel with the black sticker. I love that it tells you the batch number, the scent. I just love it. I love how they look They're aesthetically pleasing. So these are Lulu Candles. You can purchase them at lulucandles.com or directly from Amazon, which is where I have been purchasing these. They work with Amazon and I love that because we all know everything from Amazon comes in like two days. It's amazing. It's like instant satisfaction as far as I'm concerned. I love it They make candles that come in six ounces and nine ounces. So this is an example of the six-ounce jar. I have found, just from my own purchasing, that the six-ounce candles come with a lid and the nine-ounce candles do not. I also have found that the six-ounce candles come in a glass vessel such as this, and the nine-ounce candles come in also a glass, but it's either white or black. I have not purchased a nine-ounce that has come in a clear glass vessel, which is fine. I like both I thought I would note it. I did get another nine-ounce candle from them that is in a black vessel, which is also fine. I like both, like white, black, clear, all neutral, all amazing, all aesthetically pleasing Looks great on the counter, looks great in the bathroom, looks great on your vanity Just looks great. So my friend Ashley sent me this one along with three others, and the one that she sent me that I absolutely fell in love with was the Brown Sugar and Oud. This is the third time that I have purchased this scent since. And just to give you guys some context, it's been about two months. I light candles every night, as you know, and I get home and I let them burn for hours. These are 100% cotton wick. They are slow-burning. This is a nine-ounce. They're made in the U.S. They're soy candles, which is just a really buttery beautiful blend. Burns straight down beautifully You guys, I mean, they have so many amazing scents. Truly, they really do. My friend Leah really likes the Rose and Sandalwood. I have yet to try that. I'm going to order it. You guys know I like sandalwood, but this Brown Sugar and Oud, oh my god It is sweet. It also has that tonka vibe, not super vanilla-y, but it has that sensual woody smell as well. I mean, I would just pour this all over my body if this was like a lotion. I love the scent of this. I also love that for the price of these candles, the six-ounce candles start at $13.95, and they go up. They even have pillars. I haven't purchased any pillars, but the pillars go up to $28.95, so very, very, very affordable. If you buy directly from lulucandles.com, they usually give you free shipping over $30. I believe you have to enter the code \"freeshipping\" in order to get it, and it may not be all the time, but that is just my own experience from seeing the Lulu Candles website. Like I said, I have ordered mine directly from Amazon, which is free shipping for me because I am a Prime member. So yeah, these are awesome. I like their scent combinations as well. This is the Pineapple Evergreen, so it has that really woodsy, kind of tree, Christmas tree smell, but has pineapple, so it doesn't smell like Christmas. But it doesn't smell overly fruity. It just smells really nice. I can't even explain it I wish you guys could smell it. But if you're gonna buy any Lulu Candle, and you're like me and you've seen my fragrance reviews and you like a sensual woody warm smell, you need to buy the Brown Sugar and Oud, and you will thank me later. This beauty is amazing. I believe when I had the smaller version of this, the six-ounce, it said number like 66, I believe. And then if you want to go up to the nine-ounce, it says number 81. I did get a couple messages on Facebook and Instagram asking me like, \"Oh, why is the number different?\" I believe the number is different because it's a different size vessel. So I think that the nine-ounces say number 81 and the six-ounces for this scent say like 61 or 66, whatever I said it was. I don't have the vessel anymore because I burned through it a while ago. But I believe that the numbers, even if it's the same scent, if it's a different size vessel, the numbers will be different. But I believe all nine ounces of Brown Sugar and Oud are going to say number 81. That's my understanding. I just wanted to share these because this is not sponsored or anything. Like I said, I was given these as a gift and have been a repeat customer ever since. And that is because I love candles. I love candles that are beautiful and they don't break the bank because I light them so often. I can't be spending $65 on a Diptyque candle every couple weeks. I just can't, as much as I'd love to. So I get really excited when I find other alternatives for beautiful housewarming gifts. This is an amazing housewarming gift. Get a nine-ounce candle for somebody. You're spending like $20 and it's beautiful It's simple packaging, timeless, classic. It's gonna go in anyone's kitchen, anyone's decor. I like this packaging. Here they are. Like I said, also my experience is that the nine-ounces don't come with a lid and the six-ounces do. I don't really understand why, but that's just how it is. I had to share these because I love them. Over on Instagram, whenever I have these lit, I'm always throwing the link up there because I just think if you're a candle person, you need this. Brown Sugar and Oud is my favorite. I love it so much I wanted to share the Lulu Candles with you guys, and I hope that you found this video helpful and enjoyable. Maybe you would be inclined to give these as a housewarming gift or a birthday gift. Please excuse Chloe; she's obviously very into Lulu Candles. I'm gonna make sure to link this all for you guys below in the description box. Definitely play around with all the different scents. They have so many and I can't wait to try more. I hope to see you guys over on Instagram. My name is Amanda J. May, and I'm also on Like to Know It My name is Amanda May. I try to correlate everything I talk about here and link here also on Like to Know It so that you guys can find things easily and refer back without any trouble. I hope to see you guys next Friday. I hope you have a wonderful weekend."
11;"Wireless Headphones";"Sony WH-CH720N";33;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHWPhPuB5ZI&t=515s&pp=ygUeU29ueSBXSC1DSDcyME4gTm9pc2UgQ2FuY2VsaW5n";"So guys, this is the Sony WH-CH720N. It's a lot more gentle on the wallet if you're in the market for something that doesn't cost as much as Sony's flagship models, the WH-1000XM4 and XM5 headphones. But of course, for that lower price point, you can expect some trade-offs in terms of features and build quality. Right off the bat, these don't have high-res audio support, so no high-res LDAC codec streaming. It doesn't have touch controls or the speak-to-chat feature, and no wear detection either to save battery by automatically pausing your music when you take the headphones off. This is a feature that the XM4 and the XM5s have. You do get DSEE upscaling, which upscales your old music files to get them to sound more high-res, but only the base version, not the AI-powered extreme version that's included on the more expensive models. And compared to the flagship Sony's, these do feel a lot more lightweight and brittle. Like, if I were to stretch the headband like this, I feel like if I stretch it beyond a certain point, this part over here might snap. It really does feel like a different grade of plastic and the XM4s and XM5s can take a bit more punishment than these headphones. No carrying case either, so it's pretty clear that Sony is going quite far in trying to make these as affordable as they can. But what it does have that the flagship models do is the same Sony Headphones Connect app support, giving you the usual EQ settings, 20 levels of ambient mode. It also has multi-point pairing, which allows you to connect up to two devices to these headphones at the same time, and the same integrated V1 noise-canceling processor as the flagship models. So its noise-canceling power could actually be quite close to the top-shelf Sony's. The question is, how close is it going to be to the Sony WH-1000XM4 or XM5 in terms of noise canceling, sound, or call quality? We're gonna listen to some binaural sound samples, so I recommend buying headphones to hear all the details. And do subscribe and tap the bell button to stay notified of more reviews from this channel. In terms of sound quality, I tested them on flat EQ settings with DSEE upscaling turned on, and what I didn't like about its sound quality is its bass response. It hits all the right buttons for me in terms of punch and bass extension, even giving the mid-range vocals in my music a nice undertone of gravity. It's overall an energetic sound signature, and if you dig that, this will sound just fine. But vocals and instrumental tracks also sound a tad more dull than the flagship Sony headphones. It makes them sound a bit more muffled in the midrange. Comparing their frequency sweeps with the flagship Sony's seems to show a significant dip in the 3 to 4 kilohertz region, which could explain why its sound staging also sounds quite narrow and compact, which is a contrast to the open and airy sound staging delivered by the flagship Sony's. Otherwise, the 720Ns have a similar tuning to the WH-1000XM5. Listen to the following sound samples and tell me in the comments if you can hear the difference between these headphones. When I met you, we were like fire and by the way guys, if you want to compare the 720Ns sound quality to other headphones, visit a lot of wireless.com sound samples page. Link in the description Now, let's compare their call quality to the flagship Sony's using some really loud cafe-style background noise and some wind noise coming from this fan. Alright, I've now been making a phone call in a quiet place using the Sony WH-CH720N. I have now been making a phone call in a quiet place using the Sony WH-1000XM4. I am now making a phone call in a quiet place using the Sony WH-XM5. Using Sony WH-CH720N So, in terms of call quality in quiet places, my voice sounds pretty okay. It was a little muffled, yes, maybe a tad too muddy, but it's still quite intelligible. However, these will struggle with voice pickup in very noisy conditions. I mean, you've just heard it. It wasn't able to cut the background noise very well. In terms of active noise cancelling, I have to say that these are pretty awesome. When I first tried it, I thought it was very close to the XM4's noise cancelling, and it doesn't seem to have the variable ANC nonsense of the XM5 either. So as far as noise cancelling goes, these are really good for the price you're paying, as you can hear in the following sound samples, which are recorded using the same background noise that I use for the call quality test. In terms of transparency mode, I was equally impressed, to be honest. It sounded very transparent, almost like you're not wearing headphones, although there still is a little bit of screen door effect. There was very little hiss in the background, which is great. Overall, pretty close to the transparency of the WH-1000XM4, believe it or not. By the way, guys, if you want to compare these headphones' call quality and the active noise canceling to other headphones, do become a member for one dollar per month or more. This gives you full access to my personal comparison tool, which you can use to compare headphones A to B at your own time and at your own pace. Many people have joined up because they know that this is going to save them so much time being able to just cut through all the marketing and compare these headphones remotely. So become a member. Click on the link below to find out more. To conclude, yes, many corners have been cut to make the CH720N more affordable for folks who don't want to spend that much on the headphones. That is reflected in its build quality and the features. Plus, I wasn't particularly impressed with its sound quality either. I mean, it's good, but as someone coming from the flagship Sony headphones and earbuds, I do prefer its track separation to sound cleaner and to be more crisp in the mids and the highs. However, it does have active noise canceling that's extremely close to the best headphones Sony has to offer while retaining many important aspects like Headphones Connect app support and the multi-point pairing. It's also quite lightweight and comfortable to wear. Its cushions are not the most plush or soft, but if you're looking for something that's nice to use on your daily commute, this is definitely comfortable enough. A couple of hours every day, not a problem at all. So if you want something that does not require a large investment, you should definitely look at the Sony CH720N. Overall, these are pretty nice. So that's my take. Thanks for watching. Oh, by the way, guys, if you want to watch more reviews from this channel, get subscribed and tap the bell button to stay notified.

11;"Wireless Headphones";"Sony WH-CH720N";34;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEdkOrM3Kaw&t=34s&pp=ygUeU29ueSBXSC1DSDcyME4gTm9pc2UgQ2FuY2VsaW5n";"Sony has done it again. Check this out. It's the WH-CH720N, and with a code name like that, of course, it's a Sony. The one and only And Sony would like to make you believe that these are the very best value for money over here, mid-range noise-canceling cans today, and they do have a little something that makes these headphones like no other. All should be revealed in good time, and I will be referring to these as the 720Ns because I know I'm going to mess up the code name at some point. So it's safe to say Sony knows what it takes to make amazing wireless headphones. The fundamental formula when it comes to this consists of four parts: good sound, good design, particularly when it comes to comfort, good battery life, and good features. And a bonus one would be good active noise cancelling. And to be able to deliver all of this under 160 pounds here in the UK, which is the launch price, it's pretty impressive, and I do believe Sony has delivered on all fronts. Here is what Sony has upgraded compared to the 710N that launched in 2020. The new 720N has the built-in Sony V1 chip, the same one that's used on the flagship XM5s. This proprietary Sony chip brings improved battery performance, improved ANC capabilities, and improved voice pickup for call clarity. I will be testing all of these out in this video, so make sure you stick around. But before we do, let me give you a guided tour of the new design. The 720Ns are protected by a smooth urethane shell. The previous model had the gritty textured finish, which some people complained about. There are three colors available: black, white, and blue, and Sony has added a few nice touches. For example, the metal headband has a color-matching strip protecting the metal, which helps prevent it from rattling and keeps the extension of this nice and strong. When you twist and pull these apart, you won't notice any cracking or creaking noises, so it is safe to say they're well-built in that respect. There are markings on the inside to indicate the left and right ear cups, but there is also a raised Braille dot on the left ear cup where your thumb would rest if you don't want to use your eyes. The external noise-canceling mics have a nice color-coded mesh to protect them, which looks nice and catches the light. The buttons are of a tactile and clicky variety. They consist of the volume up, volume down, play/pause, and a long push on the play/pause button can wake your AI on whatever device you're using. It supports Siri, Google Assistant, and even Bixby, so this means you can control the 720Ns with just your voice. And we might as well make the most of AI while it's still controllable. There's also the noise-canceling button that toggles between noise canceling and ambient awareness, which allows the exterior sound to pass through so next time you're crossing the road, you don't get hit by a bus. On the other ear cup, we have the analog input, and an audio jack is provided in the box, so it's nice to see that here. There's also a USB-C port for fast charging and, of course, the power button. If you tap the power button, it will trigger the headphones to tell you how much power is left. If you want to put this into pairing mode, a long push and hold on the power button will do that. Now, let's talk about comfort. The 720Ns are lightweight at just 192 grams. Some people sometimes describe this padding as vegan leather, indicating that no cows were killed during the making of these headphones. The padding is excellent on the headband and ear cups. In my opinion, it's very soft, very comfortable, and quite breathable too. Sony has enlarged the ear cups compared to the 710Ns. They're kind of more ear-shaped now, so even if you have massive ears like me, you'll be alright. When I first received these headphones and took them out of the box, they had 60% battery in them, so if you're picking these up at an airport, trust me, that's going to be more than enough power than you probably need. To film this quick charge test, which I'm going to show you in this video, I used these for hours and hours to drain them down to zero with ANC on. I can tell you from my experience using them for prolonged video editing sessions, they're very comfortable to wear. I didn't notice any pinching at the top of my head. My ears didn't get uncomfortably hot at any point, and the drivers on the inside did not touch any part of my ear. I heard some people complaining about that on the previous models, but I did not notice that here on these ones. Now let's talk about power. I'm sure you and Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise would approve of the 50-hour battery life on the 720Ns. There are no spelling mistakes in the text \"50.\" And that's with noise cancelling off. With noise cancelling on, it's 35 hours. So do you realize what this means? This means just 10% of battery in these headphones can give you three and a half hours of playback. Sony says just three minutes of charge can give you up to one hour of playback, and I'm told these can go from zero to one hundred percent in around three and a half hours. Anyway, let's test out that quick charging claim. I have successfully run the WH-720Ns into the ground when it comes to battery life. You can see it's blinking red. To achieve this, it wasn't easy. I had to leave these playing at 100% with ANC on all night and some of the day to get it to this point. Just to show you guys, when I try to connect now, I can't do it because there's not enough power left in the headphones. One of the nice things about these headphones is even if you're in this circumstance, you've got no power and no way to charge the headphones, you still have this option if you happen to have a device that still has a Jurassic headphone jack. Most of the time, it's going to sound better. What we can do now is a three-minute charge of the headphones. We check the battery life, then we'll continue for up to 10 minutes and then check the battery life again. Then we'll get an idea of how much power we are actually getting in the short term when it comes to charging. Check out this cable here. This has actually got a little screen on it so you can see at what wattage the headphones are charging. You're not going to see that in any other reviews. Alright, you ready? Let's go. Okay, so that was three minutes charge. Let's see what the voice cue indicator has to say about this. Battery at about 20% Alright, that is pretty impressive, I have to say. 20% in just three minutes, that's pretty incredible. Now let's continue charging until we hit 10 minutes to see what we got at that point. I brought this out just to show you guys. If you are looking for a device that has a headphone jack, Sony is one of the only brands still rocking headphone jacks. With this, you get a 32-bit audio signal from the device, which is something you don't get over Bluetooth. Alright, let's continue charging. Now something that's quite interesting about this test is that the charging speed of the headphones is only a couple of watts. But what you've got to keep in mind is the battery inside headphones is actually pretty small, and it can be even smaller when you have advanced chips like the V1 that are very power efficient. I did ask the question to Sony about the battery size in these headphones, and it's under 400 milliamp hour, which is tiny, really, and that's probably why it's charging at such a low wattage. Okay, so now is the moment of truth. We will see how much juice we've actually got in the headphones now. About 40% So that's pretty incredible. 40% in 10 minutes, we got 20% in three minutes I do think there might have been a little bit of power still in there, so maybe it's more like 15% in three minutes. But going back to what I said before, 10% is five hours with ANC off and three and a half hours with ANC on. So that's pretty incredible. 40% here means that in just 10 minutes we've got around 14 hours of playback time with ANC on If you're going on a 14-hour flight, these might be a perfect companion for that trip. Out there If you're in ambient mode Okay, so what you're hearing now is the regular mic pickup with no noise in the background. It's quite quiet in here right now. Let's introduce some noise. Now we've got some road noise playing in the room. I can hear it through the headphones pretty clearly. I don't have noise cancelling on at the moment. The new positioning of the mics and the V1 chip combined should be delivering quite a respectable performance even when there's a lot of background noise. Now just turn it up a notch and introduce some wind. What you're hearing now is the voice call quality with wind blowing at my right ear. Let me know how they sounded. Gonna blow the wind left ear And that concludes the mic pickup test. Let me know what we got the results. So hopefully now you'll see that the Sony WH-CH720Ns do deliver when it comes to design, battery life, and the ANC. But the question is, how good is the audio quality? And when we talk about sound quality, we can't do so without talking about the app. It is this that really makes these mid-range ANC headphones like no other. Let me show you. In the app, you can analyze your ear shape and it will use this data to tailor the sound signature for you personally. This comes into play when listening to 360 Reality Audio tracks. Something else that's new is the DSE feature, which stands for Digital Sound Enhancement Engine. Check this out in the Systems tab. You can enable multipoint pairing. This is something that wasn't available before either. You can also opt to use Alexa as opposed to your device's native AI, and if you're scared of AI, you do have the option to turn it off. Like I said before, make the most of these kinds of things because maybe one day we won't have that option. Yeah And if you want to, you can add extra functionality to the ANC button. You will actually need to do this if you want that 50-hour battery life. There are no spelling mistakes in the text \"50.\" So if you want off, on, and ambient aware, make sure you change this setting to make it so. It's worth mentioning there is no wear detect sensors on these headphones. That's kind of reserved for the flagship models, but there is an auto power down feature on the 720Ns if you leave them idle for too long. So you can adjust that here as well This is a pretty sweet activity tab that will track your usage of the headphones. You can unlock badges and kind of collect them like trophies. More importantly, when you enable this activity feature, you can activate the adaptive sound feature. You will need to give the app permission to do this, and when you do, what it will do is learn what types of sound signature and what kind of noise canceling is ideal for specific locations that you visit often. You can see some of the examples of that here in this trophy list. Now let's talk about the metaphorical keystone of what holds a good set of headphones together. It is, of course, the sound quality. As I mentioned, I ran these down to zero, which took around 30 hours to do so, and I've recharged them again and been using them a lot and running them down again. One thing you need to know, any experienced audiophile will tell you that you need to run speakers and drivers in for 40 hours before they peak. This is what's known as the burn-in process. It loosens the diaphragm on the drivers, and I can assure you I've taken the time and properly burnt these in. The reason I've done this is that I realize there's a good chance some of the other reviewers who will cover these headphones probably won't be doing this. I really want to formulate my opinion of these based on their optimal performance, not just the day one out-of-box experience. I can tell you this: after the burn-in process, the difference is very noticeable. Okay, so listen here real quick. This is my opinion on the sound quality out of the box. The flat EQ profile is good, in particular, the high-frequency range and the bass output is quite substantial. I did find initially that the mid-range sounded a little bit muddy, but after the burn-in process, over 40 hours of playing Lo-Fi Girl's live stream on YouTube, the mid-range has improved significantly. I'm not exaggerating. It really is night and day. Now, one of the things I love, and I think you will love, about Sony's headphones app is the EQ options. From my tests and experimenting with all the different audio genres and presets within the app, the best EQ by far for modern types of music is definitely the Excited EQ. It makes the bass a bit more bouncy, but it keeps the clarity nice and crisp but not too sharp. For the more classic styles of music that involve traditional instruments and powerful vocals, the Bright EQ offers the most balanced sound signature, in my opinion, and it's not going to rattle your head when it comes to the bass output. Those are my two favorites and go-tos with the preset EQs, but if you really want to be moved when listening to music, you can tailor the sound signature perfectly for you. Here are two custom EQs that I spent hours fine-tuning for the types of music that I like to listen to. This one is for hip-hop, EDM, and pop. You can pause here and dial it in, test it out yourself. Then this one is more for indie and rock, and this one also sounds great with vocal-heavy tracks too. Now the question is, with all things considered, what do you think of the Sony 720Ns? Let me know in the comments. I'd love to hear your feedback. If you have any ideas for how to make my headphone reviews better going forward, let me know as well. I'd love to see that. If you want to watch a day-in-the-life vlog from when I went to Amsterdam with Sony through a recording studio to learn about 360 Reality Audio and all that, there's a thumbnail on the screen. Go check that out, and if you do, I will see you in the next one. Don't be late. Sony."
11;"Wireless Headphones";"Sony WH-CH720N";35;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vVDR_CJXww&pp=ygUeU29ueSBXSC1DSDcyME4gTm9pc2UgQ2FuY2VsaW5n";"Well, it seems Sony has done it again. The WH-CH720N noise-canceling headphones are creating quite the stir, but the million-dollar question is, why are these 99-pound headphones flying off the shelves? We've had loads of messages from you guys asking for our verdict on these 720Ns, and they're getting snapped up left and right, which is why I've tested them out so you don't have to. Don't get me wrong, my XM5s are still my daily drivers, and I'm pretty in love with them, but with a price tag of 99 pounds, I've never wanted to miss out on a bargain, especially if performance can live up to the hype. So let's see if these give us proper bang for the buck. Now, I'm not going to beat around the bush. The XM5s are class-leading for good reason, so we have got to be realistic with what we can expect from a pair of sub-100 pound cans But I am intrigued to see how close to the XM5's quality they can come without the flagship cost. Or is the extra 250 pounds a necessary spend for quality over-ear headphones? Well, let's put these to one side and put these 720Ns to the test. At first glance, these headphones look pretty fresh and are a decent little upgrade on the previous iteration, the 710Ns. They're very classic Sony with their minimalist design, and on the whole, they're nothing but nice to look at and definitely something I can see myself wearing on a day-to-day basis. Overall, the build quality is good too. The materials on the outside of the headband and the ear cups do feel a little bit plasticky, but I guess that's to be expected, and they do feel relatively sturdy. I don't feel like they're going to snap the moment you bend them the wrong way. They don't creak or rattle either, which is always a pet peeve of mine with cheap headphones, so top marks on that one. There's some nice Sony detailing on the side of the headband, and I like this strip that covers the metal band, and the external mics look good too. It's all nicely color-matched with the rest of the design, which is definitely a nice touch. I think based on aesthetics alone, I do prefer my XM5s, but that's to be expected with all the premium materials. And although these are a noticeable step down in quality, they aren't half bad, and if I'm honest, better than I was expecting. Sorry, Sony. When it comes to comfort, these are light. Very light, in fact. I think they're around 190 grams, which Sony have said is their lightest over-ear noise-canceling headphones to date, which is a massive plus for me. All of the bits that come in contact with your head are covered with decent enough padding with a nice leather effect finish, which, no, isn't as premium as the memory foam you get with the XM5s, but it does the job. And they were still way more comfortable than I was expecting when I had them on for long stints in the office. My ears didn't get too hot, and I didn't feel any headaches brewing with them sitting too tight on my head, so no complaints there. You've also got enlarged ear cups in comparison to the last iteration, so if you're anything like me and your ears are 90% earlobe, you'll have no issue keeping these on for a long time too. The only real problem I encountered when wearing them was it felt like my ear did touch the interior speakers because of the lack of padding in and around here, which did get annoying after a while and isn't something I've ever found on my XM5s. But at this sort of price point, as long as they're comfy enough to wear through long periods, then I don't think you can go too far wrong. What about controls then? Well, unlike a lot of the premium headphone models out there, the 720Ns go without any of the fancy touch controls, which is a miss for me. It's not necessarily the end of the world though, because I know a lot of you guys actually like the physical buttons, so I think it just depends on what your preferences are. You've also got your USB-C charging port and a 3.5-millimeter analog input in case the battery ever dies and you want to go for a wired listening experience instead. The majority of the magic though is going to happen on the right-hand side. Here you've got your volume buttons and a play/pause button, which also wakes up your chosen voice assistant if you press and hold it so you can go totally hands-free. You've also got your noise-canceling and ambient awareness toggle down here too, which controls whether you want to fully remove the distractions or if you'd rather have some external noise penetrate the headphones, which is always a good little safety feature when you're near a road, for example. Whilst we're talking about features though, thanks to the built-in Sony V1 chip that's also found in the XM5s, these headphones are a pretty big upgrade on their predecessor when it comes to battery life, dual noise sensor ANC functionality, and active voice pickup for calls and things like that. As with all wireless headphones though, good battery life is king, and to be fair, with up to 35 hours of full noise cancellation, I think these are going to give most people more than enough for their day-to-day usage. And honestly, I was expecting a lot less at this price. I mean, they're actually built to last five hours longer than my XM5s are, so take that as you will. It gets better though, if you're really out in the sticks with these and need to nurse the charge, you can get up to 50 hours of battery by turning off the noise cancellation completely. Plus, if you need some juice, the three-minute quick charging feature can also give you up to an hour's playback with ANC on, which is nuts. I'm always forgetting to charge my kit, and I know I can't be the only one, so I can see that being a genuine lifesaver for some of you guys. For reference, I've been testing these out all week and haven't needed to charge yet. In terms of ANC and call quality, just like I mentioned earlier, these features have all been given an upgrade in comparison to their predecessor. And whilst I've had really good experiences using these features day-to-day on my walks to work and in and around the office, I think you guys are going to really benefit from hearing it for yourself. So I'm actually going to pass these over to our resident product testing connoisseur, Sam, and he's going to show you exactly what they're all about. So as you can see, we've been out testing. It's pretty windy today. There's a train line behind me. It's a busy business park, but they're full of cars, and the noise cancelling is actually pretty decent for the price point. It blocks out wind better than it does cars and stuff, but for this price, I'm really not disappointed. It's actually really decent. Alright, so I'm out testing the call quality in these now, and we've got some cars driving past. It's a little bit windy, not as much as earlier, but hopefully the call quality comes across really well. When we were testing, we were quite impressed with these because for the price point, they're actually really decent for call quality. So, yeah, there's a train going by now. Hopefully, you can't hear it, but yeah, let us know what you think down in the comments below. What's he doing? I'm going to start with turning noise cancelling off and then ambient mode, and then turn it on. Let's see how it goes. That's ambient, and this is on. Oh, here he is. What did you think? I am very impressed with these. So when you told me that I was going to test the noise canceling on a 99-pound pair of headphones, I was expecting, you know, that I hate some static that you get on cheaper headphones I was expecting that, and it just wasn't there, and the noise cancelling is actually pretty decent. It's better with wind than it is cars, but I was expecting that for 99 pounds, you know. So, final thoughts, what are you thinking? I think overall, they're good, but they're not XM5 quality, but that is to be expected from these headphones. But the gap between them is much closer than I thought it was going to be. Okay, alright, bro, well, thanks for that noise. I'll take that back off you Now, Sony has also made it possible to get these synced up with the Sony Headphones app. You can listen without ever using the app, but there's some pretty neat features that you might want to make the most of. The first of those is ear shape analysis, which tailors the sound signature specifically to you when listening to 360 Reality Audio. This is essentially Sony's version of spatial audio, but unfortunately, it only works with these platforms at the minute, but things are always changing, so if that's something you're into, it's worth knowing. You've also got your customizable EQ sliders and some presets to really fine-tune your listening experience to suit you. If you're interested, this is how I've been listening to the 720Ns, but obviously, what works for me might be different for you, but it's a nice place to start to get a little bit more from your headphones. You'll also find the DSEE toggle, which you can switch on or off, but that should be set to auto from the get-go. You can also make use of the multi-point pairing feature too, so you can connect two devices simultaneously via Bluetooth, and you can switch easily between the two audio sources without going through the standard rigmarole of Bluetooth reconnection, which is a massive plus, especially if you're like me and you want to connect to both your phone and your PC at the same time while you're at your desk. You can also pick your chosen voice assistant and make the most of the adaptive sound control feature, which will detect your actions and location and adjust your headphones accordingly to automatically switch how you take in ambient noise, which is actually pretty cool if you ask me. Beyond that, the app's got everything you'd expect, like turning ANC fully off and changing the auto power down duration. It's intuitive, and I've not really had any problems with it. Right then, the question on everyone's lips: how do these actually sound? Well, straight out of the box, I think the best way to describe it is pleasantly surprising. The low end was dealt with really well, and there's plenty enough detail and clarity in the mid-range and highs too. They dealt with a wide range of genres really well and were pretty much unbothered by any of the more complex tracks that I listened to. They definitely feel very Sony-esque, albeit at a less high-performing level, but I think these headphones know exactly what they are. Don't get me wrong, it's not a mind-blowing listening experience, but at this sort of price, I don't think you'd be expecting that anyway. I think when you consider what people want at this price range and what you're actually getting in terms of performance, you're really going to struggle to match it. Obviously, they didn't hit the performance of my XM5s that sound effortlessly smoother, fuller, and more dynamic, but I wouldn't say they were 250 pounds worse by any stretch. And without saying this too loudly, if they were more expensive, I'd probably be okay with paying a little more for sound quality alone. Now, it's obvious that a lot of Sony's learnings from their premium lines, like the XM and XB range, have found their way into the 720Ns, and to be honest, that can only mean one thing for us as users: we're getting better headphones at a much more affordable price point, which is ultimately what we love. On the whole, I've been left really impressed with the 720Ns. No, they're not my XM5s, but they're not trying to be. At 99 pounds, we all know there's going to be some compromises somewhere, and I think no one is more aware of that than Sony. They haven't gone out there to create a pair of headphones that has one insane feature that steals the show. They've made a pair of cans that are just inherently good at pretty much everything I think your XM5s are the Porsches of the headphone world. They're sleek, premium, they ooze class, and they've got the performance to match. The 720Ns, well, they're the Volvo They do the job very well, and they get you from A to B, and you know exactly what you're going to get, and that's good value for money and practicality. I can see myself wearing them, and I can see myself being more than happy with the performance, and I can now see why there is so much hype around them. Even though they might not be for me specifically, I think they're a brilliant pair of entry-level headphones which benefit from premium technology trickling down, and for the price, I think you'll be very happy and will struggle to find much better. So hopefully I've helped you get a little closer to figuring out if these are right for you. Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you in the next one."

And now Apple’s gone and made them a little bit better. So the big question is, should you upgrade to the new model or just keep your old ones? AirPods are Apple’s true wireless earbuds, and if you don’t really know about them yet, you just haven’t been paying attention. There are plenty of other truly wireless earbuds out there, but none of them work with your iPhone the way AirPods do. You pair them by just opening the case near your iPhone, you can quickly see battery levels, turn them on or off just by popping them in or out of their little dental floss case… you know AirPods They're great. And they’ve just been dominating the market So now, Apple’s got second-generation AirPods, and you may be wondering if you should upgrade. For most of you, the answer is no. To start with, the new AirPods are almost exactly like the old ones. Same exact size and shape, same exact sound quality, same exact battery life. Sort of More on that in a minute. They even cost the same: $159 Again, sort of. More on THAT in a minute. Here’s what’s new. The W1 wireless chip has been replaced with a newly designed H1 chip made specifically for headphones. It connects to calls faster and is faster at switching between devices, but we’re not talking about life-changing speed here. It’s still not instantaneous or anything, and you’re not going to use your AirPods any differently. But the H1 chip DOES enable one new feature. You can now trigger Siri by saying “Hey, Siri” instead of double-tapping one of the earbuds, which frees up that double-tap for some other command. It works pretty well, even out on a noisy street. And though it seems to take a few seconds for the sound to dim and Siri to start listening, you don’t actually have to wait for that. Just let 'er rip with the whole command with no pause “Hey Siri, how’s the weather tomorrow?” Remember when I said battery life is the same? That’s not entirely true. You still get 5 hours of music playback and the charging case has enough power to recharge the AirPods about 4 times. I'm sorry, but I cannot see any text to correct. Could you please provide the text that needs editing? But when you make phone calls, that H1 chip makes the battery last for 3 hours instead of 2 hours. If you make lots of long phone calls, that’s huge. I also said they cost the same, right? Well...they do, if you get the regular charging case. Apple also sells a new Wireless Charging Case that can charge up from any Qi wireless charging pad. To get that with your AirPods raises the price to $199. Since most of us don’t recharge the case every day, and it charges up pretty quickly anyway, it really isn’t a big convenience like it is on your iPhone. I don’t think it’s worth the extra money. So, should you upgrade to second-gen AirPods? Really, there’s not enough difference between the first-generation AirPods and this version to be worth the money. Apple doesn’t even call these AirPods 2 or anything -- they’re still just AirPods. They just replaced the old model with this minor upgrade. The exception is if you use your AirPods on lots of long phone calls. If that’s the case, you’re probably frustrated by how fast the battery runs down. And the fact that these last 50% longer during phone calls might really be worth it. For everyone else, hold on to your old AirPods, and your money."
12;"Wireless Headphones";"Apple AirPods (2nd gen)";37;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8oT3dE0hik&pp=ygUbYWlycG9kcyAyIGdlbmVyYXRpb24gcmV2aWV3";"AirPods, love them or hate them, they have very quickly become the most popular wireless headphones in the world. Like that's not even an exaggeration They're everywhere now. So to say there was a lot of hype about AirPods 2 would actually be an understatement. I was actually on a flight recently, and the flight attendant recognized me, and she wanted to ask just one tech question, and the one thing she wanted to know was when I thought AirPods two were gonna come out. So now they are finally here, second generation AirPods. So to people familiar with the first AirPods, it might not be obvious what's different about these, or what makes them different in any way. So I'm here to tell you literally everything that is new. Also side note, can we look at this box for a second. It still name-drops air power on the side of the new AirPods box. Come on Apple, you troll anyway. All right. So first of all these cases, you can get it in three different variations, AirPods two with the wireless charging case. AirPods two with a normal case, or just the wireless charging case by itself, which can be an upgrade for your current AirPods, which is pretty cool. And they also now offer free laser engraving on any of them, which is dope. So the main advantage of this new case, of course, is that it supports Qi wireless charging, which is key. So since airpower doesn't exist yet, you can now charge these on pretty much any Qi compatible wireless charging pad, which is basically all of them, or even your friend's Android phone that supports reverse wireless charging if they're feeling like being nice. Now it won't be super fast. The case itself supports up to five watts of wireless charging speed, which is, again, kind of slow, but it's a pretty small battery anyway in the first place, so it should charge up in well under an hour. And they've moved a little LED light to the outside to indicate charge status. So red still means charging up. Green means it's full and white blinking when it's pairing Oh, and there's a lightning charging port still at the bottom, if you want to charge up the old-fashioned way, which will be much faster with the included lightning cable. Also, sadly, this might be a kind of a hint that the new iPhone coming later this year will probably also be lightning and not USB-C, like they would just start moving all their accessories to USB-C now if they were planning on that, but more lightning accessories means probably another lightning iPhone anyway. Then there are the AirPods themselves, which have the exact same exterior design, so you're not missing anything here. No new colours, no new coding, no new special waterproofing. The stocks aren't shorter or anything. The mics are the same, like it's the most un-Apple move in a long time, where there's no way to tell if someone's wearing the new AirPods or not. They're literally dimensionally exactly the same. So what is different? Why are these AirPods too? So internally, inside the AirPods, they now have what's called the H1 chip. That's an upgrade to the previous W1 chip. H stands for headphones, apparently, and these give you a couple of things. It improves sync for things like video and gaming, so lower latency, which is always welcome in the wireless world. You now also get faster pairing and switching between Apple devices, so your iPhone and your Mac or your iPod, etc., you get better audio processing that results in better microphone quality for those long phone calls. And then, last but not least, you get a longer battery life. So with the same size battery, you actually get up to 50% longer talk time than the current AirPods. So from two to three hours on the phone, which in the battery department, honestly is a pretty impressive increase year over year without actually making the size of the earbuds bigger, and they now also support Hey Siri, so it's always listening, always on, anytime. Now pro tip, you can disable Hey Siri in your settings, which, if you use it all the time, then you probably don't want to disable it, but if you do, you can get longer battery life, since it's not always listening, but just know that it's tied to your phone. Always on settings So if you disable Hey Siri on your phone, then it disables it on the AirPods. If you enable it on your phone, it enables it on the AirPods, one switch for always on listening, everything, also something else new, but not necessarily on the spec sheet. These support Bluetooth 5.0 now, they will still connect to Android phones. I did a whole video all about AirPods on Android, but still won't work quite as well as on an iPhone, obviously. And that's about it. Everything else about these is literally exactly the same, same shape, same exact sound, same exact sound. Apple confirmed this to me, no different there They still look like this in your ears, but you're probably used to seeing these now around anyway. Like I said, they're literally the most popular wireless headphones in the world. Now they do get more expensive if you want the whole thing, if you want the wireless charging case, but if you have your current AirPods and you just want wireless charging, it's 79 bucks just for the wireless charging case. I think we are all hoping For like, some aesthetic or visual change for AirPods too. I was hoping for like a matte black or some sort of colors or anything like that. But that's not a thing. If you do want to add some color or a stealth look to your first-generation AirPods, you can check out a skin from our channel sponsor, dbrand, that'll at least let you customize the look of the case, which is pretty cool. There's also a leak of these new beats, truly wireless earbuds coming out that might be interesting to a bunch of people as well. I think I want to check those out, because AirPods never really fit my ears very well in the first place. If I run around or move a lot, they'll fall out. But these are the safest second-gen Apple products in a long time. They're like AirPod 1.0, dot O dot O dot. One, super simple, but if you were in charge of a company that suddenly found themselves with the most popular wireless headphones, it's kind of an if it ain't broke, don't fix it strategy. We'll be waiting a little while longer for any sort of significant change to these. But for now, I think I'm going to go back to some earbuds that actually do fit my ears, but until the next one that's been it AirPods two Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace You."
12;"Wireless Headphones";"Apple AirPods (2nd gen)";38;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZbV3e8_PN0&pp=ygUlQXBwbGUgQWlyUG9kcyAoMm5kIEdlbmVyYXRpb24pIHJldmlldw%3D%3D";"Hey, what's up everyone? Welcome back to another video, and today we're going to take a look at the AirPods. Let's go! The second generation of the AirPods looks almost identical to the original generation of the AirPods, with a now iconic clean, minimalistic, and sleek design. The AirPods are also designed to be comfortable and secure, with a universal fit that should work for most people. They sit securely in place without feeling too heavy or bulky, although to some people this might not be the case. The white plastic ear tips stay in your ears, but they don't create an in-ear seal. This means that there's no noise cancellation whatsoever, and you will instantly notice it. One design flaw of the AirPods is that they don't have any physical buttons or controls. Instead, you have to tap on the AirPods to control playback and access other features. While this can take some time getting used to if it's your first time using AirPods, it's only a minor inconvenience once you're familiar with it. Gesture controls and volume control are very, very noticeably missing. The AirPods come with the H1 chip, and Apple says that the H1 chip has been specifically designed for headphones and enables most of the AirPods' features. Instead of having to double-tap one of the AirPods to launch Siri, you can say, \"Hey Siri,\" to activate it. But even with the H1 chip and hands-free ability, there's still a very noticeable delay from when you say, \"Hey Siri,\" to getting a response. And unlike the iPhone, there's no sound to indicate that Siri has been activated, and because of this, you can easily end up repeating yourself because it's hard to know if Siri hears your command. To be perfectly honest, I ended up passing entirely on the whole Siri experience on the AirPods a long time ago. If you have an iOS device or a Mac, this is one area where Apple has a complete advantage over the competition. Pairing your iPhone or iPad will instantly recognize the AirPods as soon as you open the case and display an on-screen prompt asking if you want to connect them. You can still also switch very easily from one device to another. The AirPods are also compatible with Android devices, although you will miss out on some features without an Apple device. The sound quality of the AirPods is not great, but it is good. The sound is clear, full, and detailed without overwhelming bass and annoying highs. The lack of noise cancellation can be very frustrating, especially when you're in places like a subway or a plane or the street. On the upside, this makes the AirPods blend entirely into your environment, so it's very easy to forget that you're wearing them. One of the benefits of the AirPods is their ability to deliver a relatively wide soundstage, which creates a sense of space and dimensionality in the music. This is particularly impressive for a pair of ear pods that sit inside your ear canal. The AirPods also feature adaptive EQ, which automatically adjusts the sound signature based on the shape of your ear and the fit of the earbuds. This can help improve the overall sound quality and balance, especially if you have a unique ear shape or size. The AirPods' dual microphone array offers better than average call quality with a clear, natural-sounding voice transmission. The audio is crisp, and the mics tend to sound closer than most competing true wireless mics do. Overall, the AirPods provide good sound quality and great performance during calls. The battery life on the AirPods is decent. I get close to 5 hours of audio playback or 3 hours of talk time on a single charge. However, the case still holds another 24 hours' worth of battery, so that's good. If you happen to run out of battery, you can do a quick charge and still get plenty of power. Fifteen minutes of charging can get you roughly 3 hours of playback, so that's good. The AirPods case comes in two different models. One supports wireless charging, and the other can be charged only through the Lightning cable. For most people, the battery life on the AirPods should be more than enough for a whole day of use on a single charge. Now, the big question: Are the AirPods second generation worth buying? That depends on your priorities. These might not have the latest bells and whistles, but they offer a very solid package for a lower price than the AirPods Pro or the AirPods Max. The second generation of the AirPods holds up extremely well to this day with good audio quality, good battery life, and seamless connectivity with all your Apple devices. So for the casual user who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on true wireless earbuds, these are perfect. They're super affordable, super easy to use, have good sound, good battery life, and I think they still look great if that's important to you. Of course, there are some setbacks: lack of noise cancellation, which is a fantastic feature that can be very, very helpful to your hearing health, and the fact that some people cannot physically use them because of the form factor. But for the casual user that can use them, these won't be a deal-breaker. So if you're not looking for the latest and the greatest features and prefer a more affordable option that still delivers great performance and the unmistakable Apple experience, these are a fantastic choice. I mean, I have them and I use them every single day, and they're still good. And on that note, it's time for me to go.

Today we've got the Soundcore P20i by Anker. These are some wireless headphones. Right now, at the time of filming this video, they're on sale for about thirty dollars with a three-dollar off coupon. They have 22 preset EQs, are waterproof, and have a 30-hour charge. It doesn't come with a charger brick but comes with a short USB-C cable, which I guess you can hook up to a laptop. Let's see, got some instructions. Okay, okay, so they're the earbuds. When you did that, I think it lit up. So plug that in. Yeah, okay, so they're charging in the case. That's how it came from the factory. And then you, I guess, you plug the case into the USB. What kind of ears do we have? I don't know. We'll find out. Here, I always thank the people who wear those white Apple headphones, they look like there's something dripping out of their ears, but I guess they work. Oh, cool, they're magnetic. So look at that, that's kind of cool. You don't have to line that up exactly. How long does this company... and it looks... They actually look pretty good. They make some speakers and stuff. Soundcore by Anker So Anker, they make a lot of USB chargers. There's a Soundcore app, but let's just try to hook it up at first just with regular Bluetooth and see how it works without the app. So see if you see it under your Bluetooth. Okay, there you go, so just taking them out of the case apparently. Did that pair? Pair Alright, well, let's play some music. Play something from the YouTube Audio Library on your phone there, and let's see what it sounds like. Yeah, it sounds pretty good. Alright, let's install the app and see what options you have. I can barely hear you even if they're not playing music, so it does a good job of blocking out sound. Yeah, I don't think they're noise-canceling, are they? Let's see. I think they're just clogging up your ears pretty good, I guess. Yeah, uh, yeah, blah blah blah, corporate stuff, skip, skip the account, plus, plus to add your new device Okay, there it is. Okay, there's a firmware update. Okay, optimize known issue That's very descriptive. Let's click more and see what it is. Not a lot of information You know, in 2023, you've got these headphones which have electronics, which have firmware that, you know, maybe they're tracking you. Maybe this is a secret government company. They're making sure you don't listen to the David Rush guy from.. Because there could be aliens. Wait, hang on. Okay, okay, so we've downloaded our firmware upgrade and then we're gonna install it. Will take about three minutes Well, I guess just as a review point, if you just want to pull these out of the box and start using them, they are charged, they do work with Bluetooth. Well, like 50% though They're charged 50%. Oh, did it tell you when you put it? Yeah, it tells me on the Google. It tells you on the Google. Is it B Google? It's a Google phone. There are no spelling mistakes in the text provided. Yes, while we're waiting on that firmware update, let's see about the instruction manuals. We got a quick start guide. Oh, it's just one giant piece of paper. Powering off Okay, it tells you to put them in there. Resetting them LED light guide Oh, pieces. Oh yeah, you can call people, so there are tap controls on the side. There's something called Pixel Buds, and you could do all that for 70 dollars and you can connect to your Pixel. Well, this was thirty dollars. I mean, for thirty dollars, we've got touch control, we've got equalizers, we've got generic batteries What is gaming mode? Turn on gaming mode to reduce latency and enhance the sounds of footsteps and voices. Okay, so that way... Probably just an equalizer since it dims out the equalizer. Let's try the equalizer. Put them back in your ear. Piano Oh, it gives you your equalizer curve up at the top. There are no spelling mistakes in the text provided. Alright, so single tap it. Let's see if it pauses. Alright, yeah, okay, that's working. Alright, anyway, so yeah, it looks like you have controls where you can say I want my single tap to be this, and you want that, and then you want your double tap to be native voice assistance, whatever that is. Thank you for your submission. With a microphone Okay, well, can you hear me okay? Yeah. Okay, bye So we're gonna just try his initial impressions listening to my Sennheisers on Tax Man and then these wireless earbuds, I guess with the default equalization there Well, let me make sure because this MediaMonkey app does have an equalizer. Oh, and I do have it on. Let me... Let's reset that back to nothing. Okay, those sound okay. Those kind of sound the same, interesting, with the Soundcore equalizer. Alright, yeah, do the bass boost. What do you think? Sounds a little bit better when you do the bass. Great! Let me know if you have any text you'd like me to review. Okay, with the wired ones, I can use other software equalizers, but these you can make sound good What do you think? They're pretty good for thirty dollars. There are no spelling mistakes in the text. Yeah Anyway, other questions that might come up would be, you know, do they fall out of your ears while you run? How often do you have to recharge them? It says 30 hours. Well, do they actually live up to their 30-hour play time? That's about it, and see you next time for another awesome video. Bye bye."

Today we're going to take a look at Anker's new budget-friendly set of wireless earbuds. These are Anker's low-end set of wireless earbuds with a lot of cool features and really good battery life, but they're missing certain things like noise reduction. However, I think a lot of people will be very happy with this if you're looking for a more budget-friendly option where maybe noise cancellation isn't very high on your list of needs. We'll take a look at the pros and cons of this, let you know what I think of them, and more. First, these were not review units; I did buy these with my own money to test out and give you a full review from myself. Pricing on these changes so rapidly I hate to give you a price and have it be wrong. I'll put a link to it in the show notes and in the first pinned comment down below. You can find it on Amazon there if you have any questions. And lastly, before we get into the review, could you do me a favor? Help us grow, help me support my family, and let YouTube know you enjoy what we do here by hitting that subscribe button and giving a thumbs up. Doing one or both lets YouTube know you enjoy what we do here so YouTube recommends our videos to more people, helping us grow, helping us support our families, and hopefully helping you decide if this product's right for you. So with that said, let's dive in and take a look at the case and then we'll look at the earbuds. Now I do love that it does come with this little strap. You can clip this on your backpack or maybe your belt, all kinds of places. Nice little bonus feature there. It does have a USB-C charger on the case, which I love. Everything should be USB-C. Micro USB needs to die It's a clamshell-type case, just pops open here. You pop open the little standard wireless earbuds. Now it does come with different size rubber tips here so you can swap those out. I love rubber ones; for me, I find them maybe the most comfortable. I also love them because you can pick out different sizes and adjust it to your liking. I also love this form factor. I find it sits really nicely against your ear. You can tap and play and more right here with all kinds of different settings—double tap, triple tap, long tap, single tap. And if you go into the free Soundcore app, you can adjust what these taps do with it. Very comfortable, very nice with it. Let's take a look at everything that came with this. I want to talk about a few pros and cons with it here, starting off with the fact that these are not noise cancellation ones. The audio quality is very good. I think for a lot of people that won't be a problem. Actually, it's probably safer, especially if you're walking in a big city. Being able to hear what's coming up behind you, where noise cancellation can block that out, could be a safety feature there. Two, the battery life on this—they advertise 10 hours, and that seems reasonable. Now, those 10-hour ones are often tested at about medium volume, so take that with a grain of salt. If you're maxing out your volume, that might not be good for your ears to do that for a long period of time, but it means the speakers in these have to work harder, they draw more power, and the battery doesn’t last as long. It does have over 30 hours of total charging when you count the case. So, 10 hours on a single charge—fully charge your earbuds, take them out of the case, put them in your ear—10 hours I think for most people, that will get you through a long day of listening to music or more as you're working in the yard, going around, making phone calls, and more. Now, phone call quality was very good. It does have multiple microphones in it. I had no problems with people hearing me, and I could clearly hear them as I used these for phone calls. As I'm working at my desk, I often use a Bluetooth headset so I can keep typing, taking notes, and more as I talk to people, which is a really nice little bonus feature there. Overall, very happy with these. Again, Anker's lower-end budget line ones. They have much higher-end ones with noise cancellation and a lot more bells and whistles. Good bass, good mid-range, good high range Now, are they Beats Audio or Bose Wave Radio? No, but you're not paying that price. If you're specifically looking for a budget-friendly set of wireless earbuds, this is one of the better ones on the market at this price point. I was very, very happy with it. These are great ones I would definitely keep around and use and definitely, I think, maybe even keep in my car as a backup pair so that I never leave home without one and always have that spare pair in case I do. If you have any questions, leave me a comment and let me know. But I would give this two thumbs up for being budget-friendly, for what it says it's going to do—it does it well—and it has good audio quality with it if you set your expectations to the price point you're spending on this. You can find this on Amazon in the first pinned comment and in the show notes down below. If you have any questions I didn't answer, leave me a comment and let me know. I'd love to hear from you. If you're new here, hit that subscribe button, hit that thumbs up, let YouTube know you enjoy what we do here so YouTube recommends our videos to more people. We would really appreciate it. Until next time, take care, be safe, and I'll be back again real soon."

I'm a really big fan of Anker products, so I bought these earbuds so I can test them out. Let's see how they are. It comes with this USB-C charging cable. Looks like these are some extra earpieces for different sizes. Open it up, and before you use it the first time, you will need to take this paper off. And it looks like these are charging in the case. Let's try these out. Hey, that's actually a really good fit. Let's see if I can connect via Bluetooth. It made a little sound when it paired. Nice touch Okay, let's see. Functionality: tapping Oh, I just turned on Google Assistant. Is that a triple tap? Go away. Okay, let's try that again. Single tap doesn't do anything. Double tap—okay, double tap play/pause maybe? Okay, double tap play/pause Tap and hold, next track I guess Tap and hold, previous track Okay, so what does single tap do? It's a good song Gotta love Van Halen Single tap does nothing How do you change the volume? I'm going to have to read the manual, but you can answer and hang up calls by tapping twice as well. Okay, so on the right ear, tap twice, it's play/pause. On the left ear, it's your voice assistant. No volume? Oh, come on. There is no way to adjust the volume on the earpieces. I think that's kind of dumb, but the sound is really, really good. So I'm going to try these out for a week. I'll be back in a week, and I will let you know what I think. Okay, so it's been about a month. I've been using these all the time during this past month when I go on trips, when I'm outside. I have ended up liking these a lot more than I thought I would. Now, as far as sound quality goes, I will say it's good. It's not fantastic, it's not amazing, but for how inexpensive these are, I am actually really quite impressed. I've used a lot of similar earbuds to this, and the sound quality is just as good, if not slightly better than most others that I have used. Now, the thing I really like about these earbuds is the thing I was initially most disappointed with, which is you can actually download an app, and you can customize the button features for this. So when I first started using this, I was initially disappointed that there didn't seem to be any way I could adjust the volume using these earbuds. But it turns out with the app, you can set that up. Super easy to do, and now the button functionality is exactly how I want it on these earbuds. So there's really nothing I don't like about these earbuds. They sound great, they're easy to use, easy to charge, and you can customize how you want the tap functionality to be. The mic quality on this is about the same as what I've seen on other similar earbuds. Nothing amazing, but it works. Overall, very impressed. Highly recommend these earbuds."
14;"Wireless Headphones";"JBL Tune 510BT";42;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L59IN5UUaG0&pp=ygUVSkJMIFR1bmUgNTEwQlQgcmV2aWV3";"Hello and welcome to another episode of Unboxing with Paul. Today, I'm excited to bring you the JBL Tune 510s, JBL's starter on-ear headphones. Let's take a look at them. You can typically find these headphones on JBL's website for $49.99. However, they're currently having a sale as of right now where you can get them for $29.95. So that is quite a deal, and I, for one, am very excited for these as JBL's packaging typically tends to be very, very nice as we can see right here with this big, nice, glossy picture of the headphones. We turn this right around, and we can see a transparent window so you're able to see the product on the inside and see what it actually looks like without any sort of image enhancement. Back here, we can also, thankfully, finally see that these headphones are Type-C enabled, so not only quicker charging times but also a more robust connector. In addition to that, we are running Bluetooth 5.0, which is going to allow for multiple connections to multiple input sources without having to pair and unpair. Furthermore, it claims to have a 40-hour battery life, which is actually somewhat impressive. However, after the Techno Mobile Bravos that we tested last time, you guys remember those had a well over 38-hour battery life at full maximum volume and those are really, really affordable headphones. We're also going to test these claims of a five-minute charge time offering you up to two hours of operating time—very, very good if that happens to be true. But let's go ahead and finally get into them and open them up. Okay, so we're gonna put the box aside for right now. We're gonna put the actual headphones aside for right now as well. We're gonna look at our packaging. Typically, most JBL packaging does come with a quick start guide to get yourself familiarized with the item. It's just in the box. We got paperwork, we got a single Type-A to Type-C cable as well as our actual headphones. Looks like it's giving us a quick rundown of how to connect, power on, blah blah blah blah blah Let's see what else do we get here. Besides that, we also got the warranty card, probably hazardous materials, and an actual—oh, more legal and safety, a lot of legal and safety. Holy cow Okay, so lots and lots of legal and safety So we're gonna go ahead and put all this aside and continue with our unboxing. So, as I stated earlier, we only got two actual items in the box, again one of them being JBL's Type-A to Type-C cable. It's a very nice cable though. Usually, these are coated and meant to be water-resistant. This kind of looks like the JBL—is it the JBL Go 3?—which has that same coating on the inside to make it water-resistant. And I do like that they're USB-A, and they usually are reversible, so it doesn't matter which way you put it in. There is no wrong way to put it in. Props to JBL for thinking about that. And the pièce de résistance, the actual headphones themselves. Again, 160 grams, so fairly light but not lightweight. You've got a plastic top with a faux leather foam in the middle, like just at the very top, not all the way around, so just where the crown of your head would rest. I wish that these—where you would adjust the two sides—were a little harder because they feel like they slide up and down way, way too easily. The material on here just looks really, really cheap. It looks paper thin, honestly. It looks like you can scratch it with your fingernail. You know, if you're, again, being a little bit too rough on this, I mean maybe not Looks like it's standing up to me scratching it continuously with my fingernail. So, I know it's not very scientific, but I do appreciate the fact that at least they label them right and left, so you're not guessing because it can be quite disorienting when watching a movie or playing a video game if you're waiting for gunfire to come from the right side and you hear it from the left side. It completely throws you off, so at least I'm very thankful for that. I do like the fact that the ends do swivel to adjust to your ears because your ears are not flat like that Your ears aren't flat like that, right? They kind of have to pivot a little bit to allow for your head or for your ears to be able to fit nicely in them. So props to them on that. But let's actually go ahead and try them on. Okay, so in all fairness, they're not the most comfortable things in the world, but let's try to go ahead and continue with the rest of this unboxing and see what they feel like and what they sound like once you're actually plugged in and on. Okay, so now we're gonna try to pair these to our iPhone. Again, it looks like you hold the power button for two seconds and it—oh, it does light up. Great That's so cool. Okay, so they've come up right away as JBL Tune 510s. Okay, so it makes that distinctive sound to let you know that they have been paired. Once more, let's go ahead and put them on. Okay, and let's go ahead and listen to some music. On a scale of one to ten, I would probably and very, very honestly give them a six and a half, maybe a seven. The highs sound very nice. They're probably turned up a little bit. However, there's no shimmering top end. It just feels like the highs are turned up a little bit high, that's a little bit And the bass is obviously very, very non-existent, especially with drivers this small and especially having something Bluetooth. You're always going to be lacking a little bit of that oomph that you would have from something that's wired in or a much, much larger driver. That being said, they are not bad. They're just not worth $49.99, which is why I think you're currently getting them for $30. At $30, they become a much more attractive offer, I guess. However, you know, for again for $29.99, to begin with, I don't really like on-the-ear or over-the-ear headphones for that matter. At least I haven't found a good enough pair, and not in this price point. You guys already know, in my opinion, save your money. So I would say definitely go ahead and save your money and either get the QCY T5 or just get some regular in-ear headphones. Don't get these over-the-ear ones just because, again, I can't really justify that price, especially for the sound quality. It's really not the best. And that 40-hour battery life, it's no longer a big selling point, especially when again you can have an item that's 10 bucks cheaper that has just as long of a battery life that is not a name brand. Go ahead and make sure to comment and be surprised so you guys can be entered into the giveaway for the Teclast T30 tablet. The moment I reach 750 subscribers, I'm gonna be giving one of these away. Again, my product is comment and be subscribed. As always, thanks for watching."
14;"Wireless Headphones";"JBL Tune 510BT";43;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUbzWd5YB8Q&pp=ygUVSkJMIFR1bmUgNTEwQlQgcmV2aWV3";"Wanna hear music like never before? Whoa, you gotta check this out. Very earthy being, oh yeah, very earthy being, oh yeah. What is the people of Earth? Welcome to the Earthly channel here on YouTube. You are watching Very Earthly Being Today we will be unboxing the JBL Tune 510 BT, even though I already opened and used this product. And I'll also give my thoughts, reviews, and honest opinions about these headphones. Now without further ado, let's check it out. Let's start off with the unboxing. Surprisingly, there is no plastic or any material wrapped around the box for packaging, which is still good and still looks neat. Now let's start taking a look at the box. First up, in the front, we have the JBL by Harman logo at the upper left corner. Hey yo, fun fact, did you know that JBL is owned by Harman International, which is also a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics? Now that right there is some info for you. Anyways, it also says Tune 510 BT here at the right side. We can also see the features such as wireless pure bass sound and hands-free calls. And of course, the elephant in the room, the product's image with some overlapping text that states pure bass and wireless. Well, of course, you can't miss the JBL logo for sure. At the bottom, we can also see the Bluetooth logo and another feature that says 40 hours of battery life, well as long as you started using it fully charged. Now at the top of the box, we can see the words \"wireless on-ear headphones,\" which describes the product itself. At the left side, we have the signature JBL photo of a man in the middle of nowhere and of course JBL's tagline, Dare to Listen. Now heading to the right side, we have another image of the Tune 510 BT with some icons indicating the buttons present on these headphones. And guess what? Another feature is that it is voice assistant compatible if you're really into that “Hey Siri” or “OK Google” type of stuff. Now at the bottom, it's just full of details, icons, and text about the product and the company. Now it's getting juicy. Here's my favorite part: at the back of the box, we can see through the product itself whilst portraying the JBL logo, which to me is a great impression right away just giving effort by means of designing the package. Bro, whoever got this idea should really get a raise, you know what I mean? He's out of line but he's right. Anyways, we see the JBL by Harman label and the model of the product again and also some additional specs such as it can connect through Bluetooth 5.0, uses USB Type-C, and five minutes of charging time is equal to two hours of use. Oh wow, they also do math here, huh? Plus, there's another JBL man in the middle of nowhere image inside. Pretty cool Now enough with the box, let's get on to the real thing. Inside the box, obviously the headphones along with its USB Type-C cable, but we'll get into that with its specs later. Back here is just a cardboard Oh, should I say it? Whoops, too late. JBL is a man in the middle of nowhere image. Shut your mouth, mate Also a Tune 510 BT text down here Now I'm actually in shock finding out how many papers are stacked in here, but of course every single page of it is important. Firstly, we have a quick start guide with, again, an image of, oh my god, please stop, not again, a man in the middle of nowhere. We also have a caution and warnings notices, and I have no idea what this is because it's in another language, but it somewhat looks like something for warranty. Correct me if I'm wrong in the comments down below. And lastly, a paper for the JBL global warranty card. Now all of that aside, let's check out the product itself. The on-ear headphones are lying weirdly, should I say, but it's because they wanted to show it in the packaging. Now down here is the USB Type-C charging cable with the signature bright orange JBL always used. Now while opening this, I noticed there's some kind of a plastic lid or seal to maybe not shake the product too harshly. So just simply take it out and boom, the Tune 510 BT are now truly yours. On each ear cup, you'll see a guide to make sure you'll wear it the right way with the help of these L and R letters. Now at the right ear cup, you will see some navigation controls such as the power button, pause or play button, the volume rocker which also can be used to play the next or previous song in your playlist, and a teeny tiny LED indicator to show if the headphones are on or not. Now sliding the ear cup this way will reveal the mighty Type-C charging port. Hey, did you like those vocals? Oh, come on bro, just stop. We're sick and tired of your junk. I am not yet sure why there are holes like this on both sides of the ear cups, but I think it's for air passage because if you didn't know, we also breathe through our ears, my guy Oh hey, now it's time to check the specs, build quality, and overall experience of these headphones. The JBL Tune 510 BT is, of course, a wireless on-ear headphone. If you want to hear a very natural experience listening to your music playlist all day long, these headphones are perfect for you. The bass surely complements the other sounds present in the audio you are listening to. Now enough has been said, let's talk about the specs and its build quality. The product currently in my hand is the JBL Tune 510 BT with, of course, the black color. Many colors are available to choose from ranging from white, rose, and blue. These headphones feature the renowned JBL pure bass sound. It uses wireless connectivity via Bluetooth 5.0 for high-quality feedback from your devices to the headphones. It has a driver sensitivity of 103.5 decibels, a dynamic frequency range extending from 20 hertz to an astounding 20 kilohertz, as well as an output impedance of 32 ohms. Now to the battery, it has an amazing lifespan of 40 hours which corresponds to 2 hours of usage by just charging it in 5 minutes. Like how fascinating, am I right? With the help of the Type-C charging cable also included in the box, charging this is quicker than ever. The Tune 510 BT also features hands-free calls where you can just simply press a button to answer or end a call and even mute or unmute yourself. The JBL 510 BT has a weight of 159.9 grams and dimensions of 8.07 by 1.89 by 8.78 inches. Now as you can see, it is entirely foldable to make it compact or, you know, maybe just punch someone using this Now this one just totally blew me away because it also features a clear microphone built inside these headphones. Now for the build quality, I'll say it's a 9 out of 10. The headphone is entirely made out of plastic which is still pretty high quality and still tough compared to other headphones in the market, but you know it's still very durable and can surely last long. Plus who cares when you're looking like Ben Simmons in his pre-game outfit, am I right? Oh, uh, you don't like Ben Simmons? Oh well, about that The audio quality is so good you can literally feel all the organs in your body bounce, bro And you know what's better than that? Subscribing to this channel right now helps me a ton in doing these contents and also you'll support the channel. Now for the price, you might get a little bit shocked about this, but it's all worth it, trust me. The JBL 510 BT costs about 65 US dollars or about 3,300 Philippine pesos or 4,800 Indian rupees. Well, overall I rate this product a 9 out of 10. I'll say it's a very great buy, especially for the people who want comfort, style, and quality all in the same headphones, which technically every single one of those is in this product. To buy the headphones, you can order online such as amazon.com, but if you are located in the Philippines, you can get it from Lazada or Shopee and even in JBL physical stores near you wherein I also got mine. So guys, thank you all so much for watching. Comment your opinion about the product right here down below. I'll see you in the next video. Bye-bye."

In this episode of Tech Visibility, I promised you guys that I would also test out the Tune 510 BTs. Now, in the last video I did, I checked out the Tune 500 BTs, and they sounded really good. They fit a little bit tight, and these 510 BTs are the level up. They are a little more expensive. These are going currently for about $50 on Amazon. The link is below in the description. I'm gonna go ahead, unbox, review, and give you my thoughts on how they sound with bass. They advertise a lot of bass. The 500 BTs have a good, crisp quality bass with really good sound coming out, and the 510 BTs supposedly have a better battery life, and we'll see if they even sound better. So, before I get into this review, I ask that you guys like the video, subscribe to the channel, and check out techvisibility.com for the latest product reviews and news as well as the article on these 510 BTs, which will come out as well. Let's get into this video. Pure bass wireless JBL by Harman Kardon These are the 510 BTs. You know, 40-hour battery life—that's the big difference. The 500 BTs had a battery life of 16 hours with a five-minute charge for one hour. These actually give you two hours on a five-minute charge, and they're very similar to the design packaging of the 500 BTs. In fact, it's identical. So I'm kind of seeing if there's going to be any difference in sound, or are you paying just a little more money for the battery? So I went ahead and cut out the two little pieces of tape here. I'm going to go ahead and open these up. Very similar design In fact, I think it's identical. They look identical. The headband is identical. These are identical. I think the only difference is going to be the battery life. Great! Let me know if you have any text you'd like me to review. So, I'm not going to go into the manual, although these don't have a silly plastic packaging in there. It's more of a tape design, but I know how these operate. So the manual, you can check out on the internet. But I'll go over the functionality here. Double pressing the plus will give you the next song. Double pressing the minus, the previous song Pressing the answer button once is to accept a call, to hang up a call, and to reject the call, you hold it for two seconds. Hold for two seconds to power these on. That's the power indicator. You see the Bluetooth is trying to pair. On top of here, you have your charging. Now, these are USB-C. The 500s were older, so they were not USB-C, and these are the vents for the cushions. The cushions feel the same as the 500 BTs—soft but a little cheap feeling. And again, the band is not there. Also, like the 500 BTs, the headband is super stiff. I mean, the 500 BTs hurt my head just listening to them for a little while, and look how much stress is on the 510 BTs. So these are meant for skinnier heads. I will put them on. Like the 500 BTs, the 510 BTs have the same size cones for their ears, and they are too small for my ears, so I feel like constantly one of the ears is either over or under, and they're just not really fitting perfectly. So that is a no-no. I will go ahead and pair them. They are right Like if I wore these for a long period of time, that's too tight for me, and I have more of a narrow head. Imagine if you're a bigger guy—that's a lot of pressure. I mean, that's a lot of stiffness that you would have to deal with throughout the day. These do fold in, so if you got them in your little bag or if you put them in your backpack or you're taking them to school, that's great. But the 500 sounded great; I assume the same sound is going to come from the 510s, and we just have a better battery life. Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and listen, or pair these first, excuse me. This is the screen for pairing, so you go into the Bluetooth, you look up the device, and in this case, it should pop up. If it doesn't, you need to turn it on again by holding the button for two seconds. And there you go, you're seeing a light indicator. The 510 BTs by JBL, or the Tune 510 BTs, are up and now we are paired. So I could go ahead, go into my app, and listen to some music here. And let's see how they sound. Oh yeah Hey For the price of fifty dollars, they're great. Can't really hear myself talk I'm immersed in the music. The bass, it's crisp. The mids are good. The lows are good. The highs are really good, so no distortion whatsoever. That bass is a crisp thump, just like the 500 BTs. I can't tell if these are much better. I think it's a little bit better in terms of sound, but they're nearly identical. The battery life is what these are all about. I wish the cones were bigger—less stress on the head But maybe that gives with time I don't notice the band not having enough support. It's fine. The music is great. Let me test these out on another song that is maybe more country-like or just more melody-like, a dance song, or.. Oh man, I'm loving these. I'm loving these They're so clear. Okay, the sound sounds so good. They're so clear. Overall, they're just wonderful. So overall, they're really good. Really clear You're not gonna have any problems I'm gonna go ahead and make a phone call with these and see how the phone call sounds as well. Hey, what's up? It's Simon at Tech. Hey, what's up? Yeah, I'm testing the JBL by Harman Kardon Tune 510 BTs How do I sound? Sounds great. Not muffled? Excellent, excellent. Alright, so I made a phone call here to you just because I didn't test the 500s. I forgot to But the 510 sound good now? I'm still sounding muffled? You sound clear? And I hope I still sound clear? Still clear Okay, cool Alright, I appreciate it. Thanks, man. Bye Yeah, you bet. Alright, so I just made a phone call. I sounded a little nasally because there's still some noise canceling here. So overall, they sound great. The music sounds good. I mean, did you see the issue with me removing? I always took my head off That's how springy this is. Comment below if you feel that way too, or if these hurt your head after wearing them for a while. On Amazon, these go for about $50. The link is below. There are about 9,300 reviews on Amazon. And with the 9,300 reviews, I could see why a lot of people have purchased this product because the quality of the sound is incredible for the price. If you have no issue with the smaller ear cups and possibly some strain on your head, you'd be fine. I say that these come in a lot of different colors, so there's the blue, the pink, and the white. And maybe for a smaller head, these are perfect. So the big difference between the 510 BTs, it looks like, is the battery life. You're getting 40 hours on the 510 BTs versus the 500 BTs, and the reason is because they have a better battery inside. Overall, that's pretty much the upgrade. You're also getting the USB-C connection instead of a mini, but that's not a big difference to me. The sound is great on both. I do think slightly better on the 510 BTs, but I would not be able to tell the difference Bluetooth 5.0, so there's no latency or lag Double the hours of charge time, so a five-minute charge gives you two hours instead of one compared to the 510 BTs. And everything else is pretty much the same on these. So overall, great product. Something you should consider for maybe your first pair of headphones, maybe something if you love a lot of music or a lot of audiobooks. I would not use these on the airplane or in any environment where it requires a lot of noise cancelling. I don't know if I could wear these all day either because of the way they felt on my head. They seem to be geared towards a smaller person. For let's say your daughter or your son, someone that's growing up like a teenager, these might actually be really good. So overall, great sound quality out of these JBL Tune 510 BTs. Great battery life Happy with them I do recommend them for those points that I mentioned. I would not recommend them as your main headphones if you're an adult traveling, etc. So that's an honest opinion.

15;"Wireless Headphones";"Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II";45;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qQ4a6Kzra4&pp=ygUjQm9zZSBRdWlldENvbWZvcnQgRWFyYnVkcyBJSSByZXZpZXc%3D";"The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are a frustrating product. They have a great, comfortable design and some of the best noise cancellation I've ever experienced in a set of earbuds. Unfortunately, though, they do come with quite a few downsides. But first, let's talk about the good things about these buds. These buds are extremely comfortable. Bose gives you a bunch of what they call stability bands to place around the earbuds. This allows you to get the most comfortable and stable fit. There's a bit of a learning curve to getting them placed correctly on the buds, but once you figure it out and put them in your ears, you'll likely find them to be quite comfortable. Now, before switching to these buds for six months, the buds I had been wearing were the Sony WF-1000XM4s, which I've also reviewed. And in terms of comfort, especially when you're wearing buds for hours on end, I found that the Bose buds are considerably more comfortable. The Bose buds go less deep into your ear than the Sony ones. I can wear these Bose buds for hours on end. When I do, I find that they sound pretty good. They're not as good as the Sony WF-1000XM4s, but I think you get a little bit more detail in the music you listen to. And when I first got these, I did think their bass was a bit much. But thankfully, they give you an EQ setting in the Bose app to make adjustments. With my adjustments, I was able to more closely match the sound profile I'm used to with my Sony buds. Now, part of what makes any modern-day buds sound good to me is noise cancellation. It's canceling out all of the ambient noise around you, allowing you to hear a wider range of frequencies that aren't being drowned out by some external noise. And let me tell you, if you want the best noise cancellation, put in a set of buds today. I think these buds are probably it. Their noise cancellation is very impressive. Especially if you just go out for a walk in a city where there's a lot of noise, it just cuts everything out. Unfortunately, there are some annoyances that I've found with these buds. During exercise, I'll find my earbuds will rotate slightly, just enough for them to let in more outside noise. So every once in a while, I have to rotate them back in so they slide a little bit more into my ears. I know that when they're in there a little bit more, the noise cancellation gets better. Now, this could just be because I picked the wrong stability bands for these buds, but these were the ones that seemed like they would fit the best. Now, another annoyance I've found with the noise cancellation on these buds is that they don't do a great job of masking either high-pitched noises or just really loud noises. Especially when I'm doing something like pounding out chicken. I've got to take these buds out because they'll just let in this clipping noise or something every time the mallet hits the chicken. And this is not something I've experienced with other audio devices like the AirPods Max or my Sony WF-1000XM4 buds. Another thing that's pretty good with these buds is transparency mode. I've actually got it enabled right now, and overall, my voice sounds clear. I think this is one of the better transparency modes. It sounds a little distant, and it doesn't sound like I'm wearing earbuds. The AirPods Max still have the best transparency mode, where it doesn't even sound like you're wearing headphones. Another great feature of these buds is their touch controls. Overall, they've worked great. They not only let you play, pause, skip forward, and skip back like you would expect with a pair of earbuds, but they also let you adjust their volume by just swiping up and swiping down, which is a rarity in the world of earbuds. Another standout feature that Bose did a good job with is the setup experience with the Bose app. Bose gives you clear instructions with animations to walk you through the product. Apart from the initial setup and the EQ adjustments, I don't really go into the Bose app all that often, except for making sure that the firmware on the buds has been updated and troubleshooting issues. Next, let's talk about battery life. Overall, it's been great. The buds are rated for six hours of playback on a charge, and the case holds a further four charges, for a total of 24 hours of playback. Just 20 minutes of charging will get you up to two hours of playback. So that's everything I've liked about these buds over the past six months. Now, let's talk about downsides. Unfortunately, with these buds, there are quite a few I guess that is the benefit of having a six-month review period. And if you like the fact that we do reviews only after six months, make sure you subscribe to the channel. The first and most annoying downside I've run into with these buds is that sometimes they'll just refuse to connect to my phone. To remedy this issue, I'll have to go back into the Bluetooth settings on my iPhone, or in the Bose app, and manually connect to the buds. Another annoying issue I've run into with these buds are audio cutouts. This typically happens when I'm out on a walk and I've got my phone in my pants pocket with the case in my other pocket. I'll just get cutouts with whatever I'm listening to Another annoyance I've had with these buds is that when I first put them in and I'm getting ready to listen to a podcast or something, I'm unable to trigger it by just long pressing the left earbud. The only way I've been able to solve this issue is to take the buds back out and then put them back in again. Another downside I've encountered is that when I'm wearing the buds and pick up a call on my phone, my iPhone won't automatically switch the call over to my buds. I have to do it manually almost every time, which is incredibly annoying. And it's something I haven't experienced as much with other buds. Another downside I've found with the buds is the microphone quality. It's just okay. Here's a comparison of the microphone quality of the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (QC2s) to the standard second-generation AirPods, the Sony WF-1000XM4, the Pixel Buds Pro, and the Galaxy Buds Pro. As you can hear, the microphone quality of the QC2s is just okay. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. I get the feedback that people can't hear me very well, especially when there's traffic or other background noise. Oddly, Bose doesn't seem to use the tips of these earbuds for microphone placement, like Apple does with their iconic stem design. I think this is certainly an odd choice. Typically, the closer you can get a microphone to somebody's mouth, the better the overall vocal quality is going to be. So I'm not exactly sure why Bose didn't take advantage of that in their design. Now, before we get to recommendations, there are a few more slides. One downside I need to cover first is the case. It's a bit big for my taste, and I think Bose could do some work here to try and slim it down for their next-gen buds. Also, the case doesn't support wireless charging, which for buds that cost close to $300 USD is a bit of a letdown. Given the high cost of these buds and the number of downsides and issues I've had with them over the past six months, unfortunately, I just can't recommend spending the money on them. which really sucks because the noise cancellation solution on these is pretty much best in class I'll continue to check in on these buds after this review. If anything changes, I'll leave that in a review follow-up in our free monthly newsletter, and if you haven't done so already, I'll leave a link to sign up for it in the description below. If you're in the market for a premium set of true wireless earbuds, Sony is rumored to be coming out with their next generation of earbuds that will be comparable to this Bose set. And from the leaks I've seen, they should improve on their comfort. Or if you're an Apple user, of course, looking at the AirPods Pro makes sense. And right now you can get these Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds on sale for a hundred dollars off at the time of recording, which I pointed out in our free monthly newsletter where I'll sometimes post deal alerts as well.

15;"Wireless Headphones";"Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II";46;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqn6xt_YP_c&pp=ygUjQm9zZSBRdWlldENvbWZvcnQgRWFyYnVkcyBJSSByZXZpZXc%3D";"All right, so since the release of the original Bose QuietComfort True Wireless Earbuds, these have been my number one recommendation as far as the best active noise-canceling earbuds that you can buy. So whenever someone asks me which earbuds have the best ANC, I always tell them the Bose QuietComfort. Now, they're not my personal favorite as far as sound quality and just everything across the board, but in my opinion, there's no question that they cancel out the most amount of noise out of any pair of earbuds that I've ever tried. So when they announced the second generation of the QuietComfort earbuds, I was super excited because I figured that they would address some of the areas that, you know, needed addressing with the original version. But sadly, that's not the case. So we're going to talk about everything you need to know about these earbuds. But first, let's start off with something that they actually did get right, which is the redesign of the case as well as the earbuds. So a big gripe for a lot of people, including myself, is that the charging case on the first generation is super large and just overly bulky. So I was definitely happy to see that they reduced the size and just made the case much more pocketable this time around. There are still other options out there that have even smaller cases, but you can clearly see this is a definite improvement over the first generation. The earbuds are also noticeably smaller and more compact. And this time around, instead of using one solid ear tip with an ear wing attached, they chose to use a combination of ear tips and what they call stability bands, which are basically ear fins. But the fact that they're separate from each other means that you can try a number of different combinations to get the best fit for your specific ears. And speaking of the fit, these work extremely well for me, so we'll talk more about that here shortly. Another thing that they got right this time around are the controls because now you can control everything directly from the earbuds, whereas before we didn't get access to everything. So now you're able to play and pause, you're able to track forward as well as track backward, you can adjust your volume, you can change your ambient mode, as well as activate your voice assistant. So that means fewer times that you'll have to actually reach for your phone. These also have in-ear detection, so anytime you remove one of the earbuds from your ear, your music will automatically pause. So let's go back and talk about the fit. Obviously, everybody's ears are different, but for me, the fit on these is incredible. The smaller size along with the ear fins and the ear tips give me a very secure fit, so I can absolutely wear these to the gym or go for a run or do any sort of physical activity, and they're also really comfortable. The first time I tried them on, I ended up leaving them in my ears for about two hours, which honestly never happens. But again, it's going to depend heavily on the size and shape of your ears. So these are running Bluetooth 5.3, and as far as codecs, they're giving us the standard SBC and AAC, so no aptX, no LDAC, or any of the more advanced options. So that brings us to one of the elephants in the room, and that is the fact that there's no single usage mode. So I just knew for sure that they would fix this with the second generation because it was the same thing on the first generation. But anytime you take the right earbud and place it into the case, the left earbud disconnects. And now I know before a lot of people will say, \"Oh, it works as long as you don't close the charging case.\" Well, to me, that doesn't count. Yeah, if you're, you know, using the earbuds on your computer and you're at a desk or something like that, you could put the earbud in the case and just leave it open. Okay, but to me, that doesn't count. What if you're outside and you want to use the left earbud independently? You can't really put the case in your pocket and leave it open. I mean, I guess you could try, but you shouldn't really have to do that with a pair of earbuds at this price point. So the fact that in 2022, going into 2023, Bose has released a pair of earbuds that don't give you the option to use them independently of each other, it's kind of mind-blowing to me because I can get on Amazon right now and find a pair of $20 earbuds, $30 earbuds that give me that option. So that's one of the features or aspects that has me kind of frustrated with these earbuds. As far as battery life, we're looking close to the same numbers as the first generation. So we're going to get about six hours on a single charge with a total of around 24 including the case. So the per-charge use is the exact same as before, but we are getting about six additional hours from the case. And they also support fast charging, so just 20 minutes will give you around two hours of listening time. Now, this brings us to the second elephant in the room, and that's the fact that they took away wireless charging. So they upped the price and then took away a feature as significant as wireless charging. That's another decision that I don't quite understand. Now, I'm not a, you know, wireless charging exclusive type of person. Like, I can live without wireless charging, but on a pair of flagship earbuds at this price point, that is a feature that I pretty much expect. So the fact that they took it away has me very frustrated as well. Another feature that I don't necessarily expect but would have been nice is multipoint connection. So with these, you're not able to connect to two devices and switch back and forth between the two. However, the earbuds can remember multiple devices, and then you can switch the connection using the Bose Music app. So as far as water resistance, these have an IPX4 rating, which means they'll have no problem withstanding sweat and light splashes of water. So that's going to be useful if you're a very active person. Just make sure you don't completely submerge them in water. So let's go ahead and talk about active noise cancellation. These are still giving you top-tier performance. So they're going to be great at blocking out lower frequency sounds. But not only that, these are also surprisingly good at blocking out higher frequency sounds like voices, which is usually pretty tough when it comes to ANC earbuds. So if your number one goal is to block out as much noise as possible, there's nothing that's going to give you better performance than the Bose QuietComfort 2. As far as the aware mode or ambient mode, it does a great job of allowing you to hear your surroundings. So it's going to be useful if you need to have a conversation or just be more in tune with your surroundings. I do think there are other options out there that have more effective ambient modes overall, but you can certainly get by with the performance on these. The ambient mode also has an option called SmartSense, which will reduce sudden loud noises. So this is going to help prevent the earbuds from blasting your eardrums if you're in a quiet environment and then all of a sudden there's a really loud noise. And it actually works really well, but I feel like sometimes it reacts to sounds that aren't really that loud, so it can become a little distracting at times. So as far as sound quality, Bose always gives us some very well-balanced sound, especially in terms of treble and clarity, and that's still the case with the QuietComfort 2. Except this time around, I feel like there's slightly more emphasis on the bass. It comes off a little bit more pronounced compared to the first generation, which is great if you prefer a little bit more punch in terms of bass. Otherwise, you can tone the bass down using the in-app EQ. So while these earbuds are definitely delivering some very enjoyable sound quality, I think more than anything you're paying for the performance of the active noise cancellation. So really quick, let's go ahead and do a quick microphone test. All right, so this is a microphone test of the new Bose QuietComfort 2 True Wireless Earbuds. So right now we have quiet conditions, so this should give you an idea as to how you would sound in a quiet environment. Now let's see how they sound once we add some background noise. All right, so now we've got some crowd noise being played on a speaker, so this should give you a rough idea as to how you would sound if you choose to take calls in a more noisy environment. Testing, testing, one, two, three Testing, testing, one, two, three So overall, these still hold the number one spot as far as active noise-canceling ability. The sound quality is also slightly improved, and they're much smaller and much more compact. But the fact that there's still no single usage mode along with the fact that they took away wireless charging—both of those things are very hard for me to look past, especially at this price point. So I'm curious to know what you guys think. Make sure you let me know down in the comment section below. And aside from that, that's going to cover it for today's video. Do me a favor: if you found it to be helpful, go ahead and give it a thumbs up as well as consider subscribing to the channel. And as always, I'll see you guys in the next one."

Many of you subscribed to my channel because of that video, and some of you might be wondering: I've had the Bose for almost a year now, and in that time, there have been several firmware updates and even some new features that were added later on, like the ability to use the left and right earbud alone and adaptive transparency. So in all of that time, have I changed my mind at all about the Bose QC2? Buckle up, because I'm going to talk about its pros and cons after 300 days of using these earbuds and whether they are worth buying. If you want to check its latest price, I've included a link to it in the description below. First, let's talk about the pros. As a reviewer, I have so many buds in my collection, but I just keep coming back to the Bose QC2 for several reasons. Reason number one is the fit. These offer one of the best stability and comfort, and the wings keep them in place very well. I myself use them a lot for running—half an hour on the treadmill with these earbuds—and no matter how sweaty my ears get, these remain stable. Second, the controls It has big touch pads which allow for a wider range of controls on each earbud: music playback, ANC and transparency toggles, and it's also possible to swipe and control the volume on both ears. So if you want to use just one earbud alone and leave the other in the case, you still have full access to all of the controls. That's worth mentioning because of how rare it is. Now, off the top of my head, the only other one that lets you do that full range of controls on one earbud is the AirPods Pro 2. But if I'm wrong and there are others in the market that can also do that, let me know in the comments. Third, the sound Now, this is going to be a pretty controversial take because the QC2s were never really meant to appeal to audiophiles. And what audiophiles are looking for is mostly that golden hi-res wireless label, which is the next best thing to full hi-res. But I find that its audio quality is good enough to please most people and not bad enough to piss anyone off, avoiding many of the mistakes that other brands make, like overly aggressive mids, boomy bass, or sibilance. Now, I won't go so far as to say that this sounds amazing, but for me, its track separation is clean enough, it's detailed enough, bassy enough, and its sound staging is open enough to enjoy. If you want to compare its sound quality to buds from other brands, visit LoudenWireless.com sound samples page. Link in the description And the last point of why I keep coming back to the Bose is its active noise cancelling. Out of everything I've tested, it cancels the most noise. The rumbling noises, drowning out the sound of human speech, it's really the only reason why I take these with me whenever I go on flights, because crying babies, yeah, it's become indispensable really. And if you do take it to the gym like me, the ANC on these does not stutter when you run. It may not be the most portable, but for that kind of noise canceling and the way it maintains ANC power by locking into my ears properly while being comfortable to wear, that's a trade-off that I'm willing to make. Actually, this is a nice segue to the first con of the QC2, which is its size. It's gotten a lot smaller compared to the first version, which was a dinosaur, but still bulky compared to my other daily driver, the Sony LinkBuds S, which is really a cute little thing compared to the Bose QC2. Now, I don't mind just bringing these buds with me, putting them in my ears, and leaving the case at home because its battery life is not bad. But if I do need to bring the case with me because I'm meeting friends or going to events, I usually just bring something else with a case that's more convenient and less bulging. The second con is its call quality. This is something that many brands can get quite right because of how difficult it is. After all, these things are so far away from your mouth, but they're expected to pick up your voice while ignoring every other ambient noise. Now, this stuff is hard, but right now it's getting better. The Nothing Ear 2's call quality is quite impressive, as are some other products, but I can't say the same for the QC2. It's usable in quiet scenarios, but if you do need to take a call in a noisy place, your voice is either going to sound very far away or a lot of the noise is going to leak in. It won't really block wind noise either, so the person on the line with you is going to hear flapping noises. The third con is that you can't turn off active noise cancelling. It's either different levels of noise cancelling or transparency. Now, the reason why somebody might want to turn off ANC is to conserve battery, but you don't even have that option at all on the Bose QC2. Con number four is that it still does not have multipoint pairing, which is the ability to connect up to two devices at once and seamlessly switch between them. Most premium buds already have that, but the Bose still doesn't. So even if some things have improved over the past year, which makes these better value today compared to when it first came out, like single earbud use and active sense transparency, the fact that it still lacks multipoint does mean that it's still lacking in terms of features compared to competitors from Sony, Sennheiser, and others. But keeping in mind the pros and cons and the updates that have improved it, I'm more comfortable now recommending these compared to when it first launched. If you need insanely good and reliable noise canceling, fit, and comfort—I mean, its noise canceling is still mind-blowingly good, industry-leading in fact—if you want to check its latest price and offers on Amazon, I've got a link down below.

16;"Wireless Headphones";"JBL Vibe Beam";48;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jPD2nOoIQ0&pp=ygUUSkJMIFZpYmUgQmVhbSByZXZpZXc%3D";"Finding a pair of quality headphones that don't break the bank and stand out in a sea of other Bluetooth headphones can be hard to find. The JBL Vibe Beam promises a lot for a reasonable price, but can it deliver? I'm Orell, and I'd love to tell you more, so let's talk tech. So, before we get into the pros and cons, I wanted to give you some important features about the JBL Vibe Beam. These Bluetooth earbuds retail for about $50. They feature JBL's deep bass sound, which is basically just the name of their sound profile. They have Smart Ambient, and probably my favorite feature overall is the long battery life for budget earbuds at a total of 32 hours. So, getting into the things that I like about the JBL Vibe Beam, these have great audio. Now, we've said it time and time again in our other earbud reviews on this channel, but Adrian and I are not audiophiles, so we're not going to study how the treble affects the deep bass and all that kind of stuff that audiophiles look at. That's just not our realm of expertise. But what I can say is, as somebody that listens to a lot of music, listens to a lot of audiobooks, listens to a lot of podcasts with earbuds, I can say that these do a great job of giving good, deep, realistic sound that doesn't sound too fake or exaggerated. I can hear the trebles, the mids, the lows, everything just fine, and the bass isn't too overwhelming. So these do a good job of having a nice balanced sound profile. Speaking of that sound profile, there's actually a customizable equalizer in the JBL Headphones app. This does a great job of allowing you to customize all the different features and different sound profiles that you want, and you can choose from different presets that are already available in the app. These are very comfortable in the ear in very specific circumstances. I'll get into some areas where these are not comfortable a little bit later in the cons portion of the review, but for areas where this does feel very comfortable in ear is when I'm just sitting up and listening to music or I'm walking around and sitting at the desk, whatever is the case. They're also very lightweight; these just kind of vanish, and I don't really feel anything in my ear, so these are very good in that aspect. These also have a nice sleek design. Now, I really like the black headphones here mainly because I am a main AirPods Pro user, so as somebody that is only rocking that, I am liking the black sleek design of this, and the case also just looks very nice. It looks a little bit higher quality than what it is. These also look great in the ear as well; they don't stick out or jut out too far, at least when you're visibly looking at them. And I do like the black look of the earbuds themselves and also sort of the piano black mirror effect on the actual front side of the earbuds themselves. It looks very underrated, and that is a nice touch with that piano black that I personally really enjoy. Now, while these don't feature wireless charging, that's not too big of a deal for these earbuds because they do have great long battery life, so I am not going to fault them for not having wireless charging. But when you do need to charge it, you do have USB Type-C charging, which is pretty much the default industry standard for charging devices at this point. So the USB Type-C does a great job of charging these at a relatively fast rate, and the fact that it's Type-C and not micro USB or anything else is great. Speaking of that long battery life, as I said earlier, you do have a total of 32 hours of battery life in these earbuds. You get 8 hours in the buds themselves, and you get an additional 24 hours in the case, so you're honestly good for a good while. And so for somebody that is like me, where I'm listening to audiobooks and listening to podcasts and stuff like that throughout my day, I'm usually able to get a good solid 2 to 3 days' worth of usage. There's not too often that I actually need to plug these in to charge. Moving on to the last pro that's sort of a con, but I'll give it more of a pro, and it's the microphones. So these have decent, passable microphones. They're certainly not bad, but they're not going to, you know, really wow you or give really good high-quality, clear sound. And so because of that, I'm going to kind of give it a little bit of a passable grade because you can at least tell what somebody's trying to say. And while these do a great job of allowing you to listen to things very well and very clearly, the microphones, while they're not perfect, they do just enough to get you by, especially at this price point. So I honestly can't complain with that. This is the JBL Vibe Beam recording of the microphones. This is what the microphones sound like. They're okay; they're not the worst, they're not the best. You can hear me in a quiet room with the microphones picking up the noise. They're okay; they're decent for $50, they're okay. Now, before we move on to the cons, I do want to remind you that if you're finding value in this video, make sure to subscribe because you don't want to miss another review like this. Here at Earley Tech, we believe that tech was made to make our life easier, so we're here to help you understand and discover that tech that was made to improve your life. Now, right up here, I will have linked a playlist of all of our earbud reviews that you might want to check out for yourself because I'm going to be getting into some cons here, and after listening to these, you might not want to pick up the JBL Vibe Beam. So moving into the first con, it seems to be a trend with a lot of the JBL cases, but honestly, the case is pretty slippery. I mean, you've seen it time and time again in the past in some of Adrian's reviews. This case is just not the best. Now, it's not the slipperiest case in the world, I will give it that. These are a little bit less slippery than the Beats Studio Buds, which I reviewed a little while ago, but these are still not the best. And while they fit into the pocket very easily and they're very sleek in that sense, they're not going to be bulging and jutting out of your pocket or anything like that. Once you actually do pull them out of your pocket, you've got to have a firm grip on the case because, well, they just might slip out of your hands. Speaking of the case, I've had these earbuds for a little over a week now, and this case is really prone to scratches and any kind of smudge from oily fingers or anything like that. It's crazy how quickly it just deteriorates the case, and I'm honestly a little bit afraid to see what these will look like in a year. The earbuds themselves look fine and great, but it's just that case that just looks completely worn out after only a week. And the last thing on the case is that, well, the case is just kind of awkwardly designed. So visually, when you open up the case, the earbuds look kind of cool how they're just situated in the case and the direction they're facing and stuff like that. That looks perfectly fine. But what I dislike about the earbuds is just the angle that you have to get them, and as somebody that doesn't have gigantic hands, I struggle trying to get these earbuds out. It's just a little bit awkward and uncomfortable pulling these out because it's almost like I need a pair of tweezers or something like that to be able to properly pull these out of the case without actually hitting the top of the case or, you know, potentially scratching anything like that. And so it's just kind of awkward and uncomfortable and just almost makes you feel like you're doing something wrong just trying to take the earbuds out of the case. Now, another thing I really don't like are the touch controls. The touch controls are very unreliable and extremely inconsistent. It's pretty crazy how the touch controls are, specifically with the volume controls, are just how they're laid out. So basically, people will do one tap on the touch control, and that will raise the volume. And you would think, okay, maybe if I raise the volume on the right earbud, maybe I can lower the volume by doing that on the left earbud, or maybe I can slide my finger up and down to raise and lower the volume. No, you would tap it once to raise the volume, and you would double tap again to lower the volume. And again, on paper, that doesn't seem very weird. However, the problem comes into play when you're wearing the earbuds and you're actually using these touch controls. For one, I'm not a fan of you having to actually press something into your ear. I've talked about this before in other earbud reviews, but these being touch controls, you would think that you don't necessarily have to jam them into your ear by actually hitting a physical button. But the problem is that when you're trying to lower the volume, you inadvertently might not tap it fast enough, and so you might end up raising the volume even more, or it might not even register what you're trying to do and might think that you're trying to do a long press and activate Siri or other smart assistants in your phone. And so it just does a pretty bad job of accurately doing what you want it to do when you need it to do it. Now, while these are also in your ear, another thing I really don't like is just how uncomfortable these are, specifically when you're laying down. So earlier I said that these are very comfortable when you're walking around, you're sitting up, you're standing up, you're doing stuff, but the moment that you're laying down, maybe you're wanting to listen to some white noise as you take a nap or something like that, or maybe you're like me and you fall asleep to YouTube videos and wake up in the middle of the night realizing that you forgot to turn off the video and you're now somehow three hours into a Sam Friedman video. I don't know how the same video keeps popping up at 3 a.m., and I always wake up to it, but alas, what ends up happening is whenever you're laying down with the earbuds in your ears, they're just very, I don't know, they're just very uncomfortable and they stick out just enough to put a weird pressure on the inside of your ear that is really irritating. And so if you're somebody that doesn't lay down with earbuds or whatever is the case, this con might not be an issue for you, but as somebody that might fall asleep listening to these, or maybe like I said, you're setting yourself up to listen to some white noise taking a nap or whatever's the case, you're eventually going to have this weird pressure on your ear when you're laying down. And so with all of these cons and the pros I mentioned earlier, I want to give a final rating of about 7.5 out of 10. So these are not the worst earbuds that I have ever seen or used, but these are certainly far from the best. And there are a lot of things that they could improve on in some ways. There are some things that are minor that could easily be fixed in software and some things in the hardware that just need a complete overhaul, like with the case and the design of the earbuds themselves. But all of that said, these are not the worst earbuds, and if you're looking at picking up affordable earbuds but not wanting to break the bank, wanting to get something that at least does the job and does the job fairly well, you're not going to be disappointed in these. But if you're wanting to get something that sticks out in the crowd of other earbuds that are around this price point, well, you might want to look somewhere else. At least that's my take on it. But maybe you want to check out some of our other earbud reviews. Well, definitely check out this review that Adrian did on the JBL 2230. These are honestly the better value for a still relatively affordable price, or you can check out my review of the Beats Studio Buds and the AirPods Pro in this video right here. I'll catch you in those videos. Peace."
16;"Wireless Headphones";"JBL Vibe Beam";49;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLu3eetfCnw&pp=ygUUSkJMIFZpYmUgQmVhbSByZXZpZXc%3D";"Look at these little guys. They're called the JBL Vibe Beam in-ear true wireless earbuds with plenty of bass at an affordable price. I'm talking through all of the details right now so you know if they're a good fit for you. Andrew from Apt here with the JBL Vibe Beam true wireless earbuds. They're fifty dollars. They come in black and white, and they're called Beam because of this little guy right here. JBL actually has two other models in the line: there's a bud that removes the stick and the Vibe Flex that leaves it open. These are just simple and stylish. Now I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, \"Andrew, you can make anything look stylish.\" How do I know if they look stylish on me?\" You're thinking that, right? Fortunately, we have them on display at the Apt store, so you can come by and check them out. Also, links below to check them out online. But let me tell you some details first. These guys were first announced at CES a couple of months ago, and the idea is generally to bring decent specs to affordable true wireless earbuds, and fifty is really nice for true wireless buds from a reputable brand. The buds themselves are rated IP54 resistant, which means they can resist dust and they can withstand splashes from water. The case is IPX2, so it's not tested for dust, but it's kind of water-resistant itself. Between them, you get 32 hours of battery life: eight on the buds, 24 on the case. They can also charge pretty quickly, so if they're out of juice, you can give them a couple of hours of life after 10 minutes of having them plugged in. They have an eight-millimeter dynamic driver, 16 ohms of impedance, and what JBL calls deep bass sound. Given the longer battery life, JBL added another feature to help you keep them on throughout your day: Ambient Aware and Talk Through mode. And yes, I just said two things, but there are two sides of basically the same thing. Ambient Aware intentionally lets sound through the headphones so you can hear what's going on around you, and Talk Through is a version of that that makes background noise a little quieter and voices a little louder, so you can have your music playing and then have a quick conversation with your co-worker in which he tells you to stop roping him into goofy cameos in videos. And then you can go right back to writing the script that includes his goofy cameo. And because you have the earbuds in, you can pretend you didn't hear them. You did; you had Talk Through, but you can pretend you didn't. You can also hear your own voice when you're on a call, if you want, with Voice Aware, and you can customize how much of your voice to hear with the JBL app. If you're a loud talker, such as no one I can think of, you can turn that right on down. So, app compatibility, bass emphasis, Ambient Aware, Talk Through, plenty of battery life, and style to boot—JBL fit a lot into these fifty dollar buds. But I guess I shouldn't call them buds since those are a different shape of the same JBL Vibe line. JBL fit a lot into these beams. So, beam them up on your headphone shortlist and beam yourself down to Apt to try them on because it's a Star Trek reference. And speaking of sci-fi, you don't even have to check them out in person. You can check us out online, over the phone. I mean, talk about futuristic tech—how cool is that? Also, be cool if you would like and subscribe, pretty please, and thank you very much for watching."

It has a matte black finish with the JBL logo right here on the front. On the inside, we have the JBL earbuds, and then there's also an LED indicator right here letting you know the charge status of the earbuds. All right, so these come in a matte black with a gloss finish over the front of them with the JBL logo as well. Then they also have an LED indicator letting you know the connectivity and the charge of the earbuds. You also have a stamp right here letting you know which ear the earbud goes in. This one is the left one, and this one is the right one. Now again, you do have interchangeable tips for these depending on the size of your ear, so that way they fit very comfortably in your ear. They're really comfortable, they're lightweight, and they feel like they're pretty snug in there and they're not going to fall out. So if you're into fitness and maybe you like to wear these to the gym, they won't come out of your ear while you're exercising or running."

In today's video, I'm going to be doing a review on Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner. Now, as you may know, the Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner is a very safe choice for your cleaning purposes, especially if you are allergic or have a bad reaction to bleach or ammonia. Simple Green is biodegradable. You can use it on your baby chair, on your kitchen floor, in your kitchen cabinets—like I said, it's all-purpose. It's definitely concentrated just for all-purpose use. Another reason why we like it is because we have a baby seat and a baby eating table, and we just don't trust using the other types of all-purpose cleaners because of the chemicals inside of them. What we have here is the standard bottle. It has 22 ounces and cleans super well. As you can see right here, I have a nice little dainty table. So, I'm going to go ahead and wipe it down and spray it. If you really want a biodegradable, very good all-purpose cleaner, then Simple Green is just what you're looking for. We use Simple Green all the time, and I wouldn't say that Simple Green is better than Lysol or any other brand, but it gets the job done. It is definitely safe and healthy for your family. We even have our kids using Simple Green. They go in their bathroom and clean their own bathroom and toilet because we know that this is a safe product. As you see in the back, there are different versions of this. You have the heavy-duty purpose, and this bottle already comes concentrated, so you don't have to do any mixing or anything like that. I hope you like this review. Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner is definitely strong and powerful. It will clean up dirt, grease, and grime. You can use it on your brakes and for multi-purposes. Thank you for watching this review."

Now, this one is specifically ready to use, and that's important to check. They do also sell concentrates that you can mix, so just be sure and check before you use it if you're purchasing the concentrate or the ready-to-use option. It should say on the packaging. Typically, the ready-to-use will have the spray nozzle at the top, whereas the concentrate will not, but that is something to always double-check. Now, we've used this cleaner for just about everything. It's not abrasive, it is safe to use on virtually all surfaces, so I've used it to clean floors, used it to clean walls, used it to clean countertops, anywhere in our kitchen, bath, flooring, you know, for kids making a mess in the living room. We have used this product on it, and it has worked well. Now, it's not going to be abrasive, so if you're trying to scrub something out, maybe you've got massive stains on something, then this might not be the best product for that just because it's not abrasive. So scrubbing it won't get that kind of rubbing motion that you'll need for cleaning those things. But overall, it does do a good job in cleaning pretty much everything around the house. It has some simple directions. It says not to use on suede, leather, unfinished wood, opals, or pearls. So pretty much as long as you're not cleaning that, then you are good to go on cleaning it, which most people aren't going to be trying to clean unfinished wood, suede, leather. And I guess opals and pearls are important to keep in mind if you happen to have opals or pearls. But definitely a good all-purpose cleaner to have around the house."

Today's focus: I am testing Mrs. Meyer's Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner I've had many viewers suggest that I test Mrs. Meyer's products in my home with my bacteria testing Some of those viewer requests come from Trisha, Blaze, Jody, Grace, Cali, Kim, Page, and Fate Wine Roses Mrs. Meyer's products seem to be pretty popular among my viewers, so I purchased some Mrs. Meyer's Multi-Surface Spray, and I chose the scent Lemon Verbena I should point out nowhere on this product bottle or their website do they claim to be able to remove bacteria. They do not claim to be a sanitizer, do not claim to be a disinfectant; it just claims to be a cleaner. But we're going to test it anyway in my home to see if it can remove bacteria. In order to see how well Mrs. Meyer's does remove bacteria from my home, I'm going to take a picture just like this guy here, and I'm going to label it A, B, and C. I'm going to take some sterile swabs and swab various areas around my home, such as the kitchen counter, kitchen sink, bathroom sink, toilet room, and I'll place those samples on the petri dish labeled B for before. Then I'm going to clean according to the directions on the Mrs. Meyer's bottle Those directions state simply spray and wipe away, so there'll be no time on this A lot of times when I'm testing a product that claims to be a disinfectant or a sanitizer, there'll be a 30-second to five or even 10-minute wait before I'm supposed to wipe it clean. However, this just says spray and wipe, so that's exactly what I'm going to do. After I'm done wiping, I'll take a second sterile swab, swab the area again, and place that sample on the petri dish in the area labeled A for after. C is my control; nothing's going to go there. So let's see how well Mrs. Meyer's can remove bacteria from my home. [Applause] Now for some results: The kitchen counter—in the before section, we can see a lot of bacteria there, and in the after section, there are a few tiny bacterial colonies there. So Mrs. Meyer's does an excellent job at removing bacteria from my kitchen counter. The kitchen sink—in the before section, we can see a lot of bacteria there, and in the after section, there's nothing There are no bacterial colonies growing at all, so Mrs. Meyer's does an excellent job of removing bacteria from my kitchen sink. The kitchen sink drain—in the before section, there are a ton of bacteria there; it's a huge smearing of bacteria. And in the after section, you can see three big visible bacteria, and there's also about half a dozen tiny bacterial colonies floating around there. So Mrs. Meyer's does a great job at removing bacteria from my kitchen sink drain. The bathroom sink—in the before section, we can see a lot of bacteria, and in the after section, you can see one or two big colonies, and there's actually about half a dozen small tiny bacterial colonies on the dish. But overall, Mrs. Meyer's does a great job at removing bacteria from my bathroom sink. The toilet rim—in the before section, we can see a tremendous amount of bacteria there, and in the after section, there's about a dozen small bacterial colonies. So we can see a major visible decrease in bacteria, and Mrs. Meyer's does a good job of removing bacteria from my toilet rim. Overall, I'm very impressed with how well Mrs. Meyer's was able to remove bacteria from various surfaces around my home, even though they make no claims at all to be able to remove bacteria. For those of you wondering about the scent of this product, I did choose Lemon Verbena. It is very, very strong. When I first started spraying it on my kitchen counter, that's the first time I used it, I actually stopped, looked at the bottle, made sure I didn't actually have a concentrated version of the product—that's how strong it is. To me, it smells really nice. It's not choking, it's not chemical-smelling, but it is strong. It does linger for quite a while, but the scent, you know, decreases over time. It's a nice scent; it's an enjoyable scent; it's just very, very strong. I want to thank the viewers who suggested that I test Mrs. Meyer's I was pleasantly surprised with these results. I really enjoy it when a product makes no claims at all to being able to remove bacteria, and it does an excellent job. So great job, Mrs. Meyer's If there is a product that you would like me to test out, do me a favor and put it in the comments, and I'll add it to my viewer suggestion list.

I want to show you another one of my favorite cleaners. This one is the Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Multi-Surface Concentrate What I love about this cleaner is, first of all, it's concentrated. So I do have my little one that I got at the grocery store, and what I do is I take my refills, put it inside, mix it with some water, and I have a whole other bottle of cleaner, which is great. Another reason why I love this is the smell. This one is the Lemon Verbena. It has kind of a mild citrus scent, which smells so good when you're washing your floors, your countertops, anything like that. It's biodegradable; it has 98% natural cleaners in it, which is great. It makes your place smell amazing. It's safe on hardwood, tiles, countertops, walls. Just a great product. But that's just our point of view."

My wife uses it, but I just grabbed it and started using it myself. This stuff works really well. Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner removes dirt, freshens surfaces. We usually use this in the kitchen for countertops and tables and stuff like that. But I was just pulling this dryer out because I gotta pull this vent and clean it out because it's getting backed up with the lint and stuff. Of course, there's some kind of spillage or dirt and all spread out there. As you can see, it's kind of clean right here. All I did was just spray this on there. This stuff was caked on there pretty bad. It's been sitting there, just drying up and sticking to the floor. So I just sprayed that on there, let it sit for a minute, and then took a paper towel and just wiped it across there. Look how clean it gets there. It cleans it very well, and it smells good. Like I said, this was the basil scent. It's got me wondering what else I can use it on. I'm telling you, this stuff works so well, it makes you want to clean your house and keep cleaning it just because of how nice of a result you have after you clean things. Then you realize how dirty it was, but also how clean you can get it with Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Yeah, Meyer's You can eat off these floors. I know I would."

I'm Nikki with LuckyVitamin, here to talk about my Lucky Pick, Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Multi-Surface Cleaner in Lemon Verbena scent I love this Mrs. Meyer's cleaning line Everything in the line is amazing I use this product in every room of my house. Not just the bathroom, the kitchen, every single room I have even used it to clean windows, my fridge, appliances, you name it, I've used it to clean it. I have kids, so I'm always worried about food surfaces and, you know, other harsh chemicals. You have to wipe them down again after you use them. This, you don't have to I don't mind just wiping and going, and I don't have to worry about that. So, it not only comes in this Lemon Verbena scent, it comes in really cool basil, honeysuckle, lavender, a wide variety of scents that we sell. When the bottle's empty, I buy the liquid concentrate, which also comes in the same scents, and you just put a little bit of concentrate in the bottle, fill it up with water, and there you go, you've recycled your bottle. It's very natural and clean, free of parabens. It doesn't smell like harsh chemicals, so I love that I can clean my house and not get an overwhelming smell of chemicals. That's why I love it. Give it a try. If you love it too, tell your friends, tell your family, and spread the wellness."

After everything has been wiped and dried, you can see that there is no longer any dirt anywhere on the ground, and in fact, all of it is right here on these paper towels. And it smells pretty good too. All in all, I'd say this is one of the best multi-purpose cleaners I've used. Not only does it leave behind a good smell, but it also really cleans the surfaces. Take my word for it. The only issues that I could find with this product are that it's a little hard to get a hold of, which may give merit to the fact that it's a very good product because people are buying it up. Some people may not have as ecstatic reviews of it as I do. So, aside from the fact that I had to travel all around Atlanta to find this product, I'd say it's a very, very good multi-purpose cleaner. I definitely give this about four and a half stars. Thank you for watching my review. I'm Peter Simon, and this has been the Mr. Clean Multi-Purpose Cleaner with Febreze."

I just wanted to show you quickly. Kills 99% of bacteria, 99.9% kills germs Tested and proven to kill COVID-19 virus. This is a really good all-purpose cleaner, and it has a great lemon breeze scent. So anyway, I want to spray some of this on this paper towel here and just show you a little bit about what you can bring up because sometimes when you clean, you don't actually know if you're getting anything or if you think a surface is already clean. You may not think so, but check that out right there, okay? So you can also use this over on your wood table or your seats, anything like that, and we're gonna just clean that up. You can already see all the nice lemon scent as well Good for cleaning chairs and tables and high chairs, anything like that, but you can also use it on your sink as well. So if you want to shine that sink up a little bit better, easily put some lemon scent in there and rinse it down. Put that lemon scent down in that disposal as well to freshen up that InSinkErator. That is for the Lysol All-Purpose Cleaner."

This is the Lysol All-Purpose Cleaner. This is the Lemon Breeze scent. We absolutely love this in my house. We use it everywhere. You check out the back; it tells you that you can use it in the kitchen, in the bathroom. I mean, we use this in our toilets, we use this in our sinks, in the shower. We absolutely love the scent. There's just something about that lemon fresh scent that really makes you, you know, know that it's clean. And then there's three different ways you can use it. So you can clean, you just spray it on, wipe it right off. You can sanitize, where you spray it on, let it sit for 10 seconds, and then you wipe it off. Or disinfect, which is what we do to our kitchen sink after we, you know, cook with different raw meats and things like that. We spray it, leave it for two minutes, and then you wipe it. That'll disinfect the surfaces really well. So all in all, you know, great product. We love the scent. It's a classic scent. Really can't go wrong with it. So check it out."

Today, I'm going to be doing a review for you on this Lysol All-Purpose Spray Cleaner in the Lemon Breeze scent. They do have other scents available, but this is the only one that I have tried in this particular cleaner. As you can see, I have made my sink extremely dirty for you guys, and you're not gonna believe this, but I have actually let my sink stay like this for 24 hours, which is very unlike me. I'm not even gonna get into it, but yeah, I did But just to save time, I'm not even going to explain it. But anyway, I showed this in my latest haul video, and I also showed the orange Lysol Kitchen Pro Antibacterial Cleaner. I took a poll on Instagram and asked you guys which one you wanted to see me review first, and the majority picked this one. So I will still be reviewing the other one, just this one's coming first. So as you can see, the sink is extremely dirty, and yes, I made it dirty and then ended up not being able to film because I had to go to work, and so it sat and it got dirtier. And here we are. So I'm gonna set you up, and we will get started. Okay, guys, one more thing I wanted to let you know is a great thing about this cleaner is, well, first of all, it disinfects. It also is able to sanitize There is a difference. I will be making a video very soon explaining that and a lot of other things that you guys are curious about—just cleaning tips 101, I guess. But what I wanted to say is most disinfectants take at least 10 to 15 minutes to work, and this one and the other one that I was talking about a minute ago, they are able to disinfect in two minutes. So that saves a lot of time. And also, when you're disinfecting, you need to keep the surface wet for the full amount of time. So for ten minutes, that's a long time. You have to keep coming back and spraying, spraying, spraying. So it is actually quite the product too. Okay, so the sprayer is on, and I'm just going to thoroughly wet all the surfaces so that this will properly disinfect. Like I said, to disinfect some things, you have to be soaking it, and it needs to remain wet for the full amount of time that it is supposed to sit on the surface. So if it starts to dry like that just did or if you need to spray it again—a lot of people don't know that, so a lot of people want to do that, but they're not doing that—you are not disinfecting. Sanitizing takes a lot less time, usually about 30 seconds, but it doesn't kill as many viruses or germs. So I'm gonna let this sit, and I'll be back in two minutes. Okay, so I'm kind of dumb because I'm sitting here and I'm like, \"Wow, look how dirty my sink is.\" And then I realized, \"Wow, it's really dirty.\" This product is not going to disinfect at all, so why am I waiting two minutes?\" So there's no point in me really waiting two minutes, so it's really sat about 30 seconds. So I'm just going to see if it will clean right on it. No, that's fine. And I'm probably not going to show the whole process of scrubbing because it will probably take a bit, but I'll show you guys initially how it works and how it takes off the tough spots like this in there. There's some stuff left behind, and wow, that literally came right off the tap. That came right off. I've never cleaned something this dirty with this I think I've said really, I'm pretty clean, like I'm really messy, first of all, would not get this dirty in the first place And I think it's clearly getting clean. Look at that That comes off, and if you're not disinfecting, I'm not. So I wouldn't even need to use this much product unless I was disinfecting. And like I said, you cannot disinfect something that is this dirty, so you have to pre-clean before disinfecting. If you see how much cleaner is going into the sink right now, I do not need to use even close to that much just to clean this, so don't make that mistake. Okay, here's the tough part. Let me see if I can zoom you in. Okay, so that might be a little better, but because of the angle that you're at, you might not be able to see it as well. But I'm barely putting any pressure, so I'm going to see how that works first. Okay, it came off, but with a little bit of elbow grease and pressure, it would have come off a lot faster. There's another big spot right here, but you're not gonna be able to see it, so I'm going to do it right here. Yeah, more pressure, it's coming right off. And like I said, guys, this has been sitting for over 24 hours, so it's not fresh. It's not bad right off, just water or something. All right, so are you seeing this? Look at the difference. That was so quick. This actually, like I said, I don't typically have messes that big, but I am so surprised at how well this cleaned it up. When I sit in houses, I did not use this, but maybe I should have. That worked so well. So I recommend if you have kids, if you just don't clean your bathroom that often, whatever the case may be that you might have a dirty sink, dirty toilet, whatever you want something quick that works, the Lysol All-Purpose Spray Cleaner is definitely a good way to go. Like I said, the smell is a little bit strong. I've been in here with the door shut so that it's quiet for you guys, and it's a little strong for me. And I said I am not typically sensitive to chemical cleaners, but the door is shut. So if you are sensitive, you either want to open the windows, just make sure it's ventilated, have a fan on, something. But it smells nice. It works really fast. I just read the bottle, and it actually said most disinfect in 30 seconds. This one actually does disinfect. I'm sorry, did I say disinfect? It sanitizes, and most cleaners sanitize in 30 seconds. This one sanitizes in 10 seconds, I think it said. Yeah, 10 seconds That's awesome. So yeah, I think this was about two dollars and fifty cents. It wasn't more than three dollars, so yeah, I definitely recommend it. You can get it just about anywhere: Walmart, Family Dollar. I think I got it from the grocery store, so it definitely gets the approval from me. So I hope you guys enjoyed this review. I'm very happy with my clean sink now, and I will see you guys in the next video."

This is an all-purpose cleaner, a cleaning product that is said to kill germs and bacteria on all different surfaces. They claim to kill 99.9% of viruses and bacteria. I cannot, I guess, I don't know if I could vouch for this because I don't have anything to measure how much bacteria I've killed, but I'll take their word for it. It works really well with cleaning up spills and gunk. I don't know why I have so much gunk in my house. I'm a very messy person, to be honest, and I always am spilling things and just leaving things around, and I'm a slob. So having this on hand is very important for me. It also fights grease, and it's hard to find a good product that really fights through grease, in my opinion, and this does the job. So I'll use it sometimes to clean my kitchen, like the stovetops and things like that, just to really give a thorough cleaning. I also use it in the bathroom and everywhere in the kitchen. Maybe not inside the coffee pot, but the outside works fine, and on the surfaces, countertops—basically, it just makes everything sparkly and squeaky clean. This is great to have because it's all over me most of the time. Like, I could stock up on a lot of different cleaning supplies, but like I said, I'm a slob, and having just one thing that works really well is just what I need. I don't need to get anything else. It works for almost everything, but if you have a carpet or something like that, I would say maybe get a carpet cleaner. Don't rely on Lysol It's good for hard surfaces mostly. I buy it whenever I run out. It's basically been around with me for quite some time. I moved into my apartment about nine months ago, so I would say I've been replenishing it ever since then whenever I run out. This is a fairly large bottle, 32 ounces, and my boyfriend does use this too, so it's something that doesn't run out very often. And like I said, I don't clean every day, but you get the picture. I will be replacing this when this runs out. Now, this particular size definitely lasts a lot longer than other Lysol products. They have wipes and other smaller containers, so I definitely feel like this one was the right one to go with. And it deodorizes, so it takes away really bad smells and it doesn't just wipe them up, which is nice. But I do have to warn you, the smell can be very overpowering. So if you're cleaning a really small room or area and you're just spraying this everywhere, maybe wear a mask or just be prepared to hold your breath a little bit, just because it's a lot. You can still smell it, it's like breathing it in, and it's not pleasant. But overall, it's a decent smell, if that makes any sense. The smell is Lemon Breeze, so it's supposed to be lemons and whatever breeze smells like. It's a decent smell. I bought this in a time when I really needed to have cleaning supplies, and so it wasn't like something that I just chose to buy randomly. It was really out of need. And so the fact that this really suits my needs is very important. I'm pretty minimalist. I wouldn't travel with this, and I don't carry it around with me. It's really bulky and kind of heavy, and frankly, I don't know why you would bring it with you. But the bottle is very durable plastic, and the spray head is just.. There's a nozzle here, and it just sprays. You press down, and then the liquid comes out. You aim it at wherever you want to go. This right here, if you twist it, it can shut it, so it will turn off the ability for it to spray. But overall, pretty simple, straightforward mechanism. There's no bleach in this one, so keep that in mind. You would have to get bleach separately if you want to get bleach. I just keep it under my kitchen sink with my other cleaning supplies. To use it, you just aim at a spot that you want to clean and then you wipe away that area with a cloth or a sponge or rag or whatever you use to wipe things with. Yeah, so I definitely like having one in my house at all times. I've tried a few other all-purpose cleaners, but this one just seems to be the best. It just really fights that grease. That's what I need. The substance is clear, it's not like soapy, it's more just shooting out soap. That's what it looks like. It's made in the USA. Lysol was introduced in 1889, and they specialize in cleaning products. So you can find a lot of their cleaning products, and I would definitely check it out. Thanks so much for watching."

Now, it removes stubborn dirt and grease with very little effort. I have used this in my kitchen, my bathroom sinks, my stove, my stubborn pots and pans, and my bathroom shower tile. It's really easy to use. As you can see, it's just a spray bottle, so you can spray it on your counters. I've sprayed it on my slow cooker. You can spray it on your tile floors. I have ceramic tile in my bathroom shower. It has really helped to remove the calcium buildup on my tile, and I recently used it to take the scuff marks off my tennis shoes. This cleaner is absolutely amazing, and my favorite thing about this cleaner is that it's made with 100% natural ingredients. It is vegan-friendly and cruelty-free, and it has a pleasant rhubarb scent that leaves your home smelling fresh and very clean. So, if you have never tried the Pink Stuff products, I highly recommend them and this multi-purpose cleaner."
