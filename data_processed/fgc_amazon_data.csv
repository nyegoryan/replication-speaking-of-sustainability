 Directions 
 Use as-is, or dilute with clean, ambient water. Spot test on a hidden area first. For tough, greasy, oily or sticky stains use full-strength or a Heavy Dilution of 1-part Simple Green to 1-part water. Use on oily, greasy, sticky or heavily-grimed items such BBQs, engines, tires, driveways and tools. For everyday cleaning and average household dirt, grime, and spills use a Medium Dilution of 1-part Simple Green to 10-parts water or mix 1 ounce of Simple Green with 1 cup of water. Use on sinks, tubs, toilets, etc. For light cleaning of non-sticky soils or dust use a Light Dilution of 1-part Simple Green to 30-parts water or mix 1 ounce of Simple Green with 4 cups of water. Use this ratio to clean items such as bikes, toys, floors, polished marble, sports and exercise equipment, stainless steel and painted walls. To use, apply solution via pour, spray, mop or sponge, leave on heavy soils for 1 to 2 minutes, scrub if needed, rinse or damp-wipe with clean water, and repeat if needed. Do not use on suede, leather, unfinished wood, opals or pearls. When using carpet extraction cleaners, pressure washers, or other cleaning equipment use a medium or light dilution. For use as a laundry detergent enhancer, add 1/4 cup of full-strength Simple Green along with your detergent as the tub fills with water. Add your laundry and wash as usual. For greasy clothes, clothes permeated with smoke, and other heavy soils, add 1/2 cup of Simple Green to a large load and let soak for 30 to 60 minutes prior to washing.
