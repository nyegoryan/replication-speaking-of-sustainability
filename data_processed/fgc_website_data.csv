The luxury House immediately became a leader in fashion and culture following its founding in 1978 by Gianni Versace, and it continues to lead with purpose under the creative vision of Donatella Versace and leadership of Emmanuel Gintzburger. Versace's energy comes from its clash of irreverent references. The tension between classical and contemporary; Italian tradition with the latest innovation; rock music with royalty; myth with today’s celebrity stardom. This unique formula shapes a creative culture that is expressed through now iconic designs, world-leading imagery, true fashion moments, and a heritage of innovative Italian artisanship. The Versace name is identified with a lifestyle and attitude that celebrates uniqueness and the power of a person who feels the ultimate freedom to be themselves. The Versace lifestyle includes women's, men's, and children's ready-to-wear, shoes, bags and accessories, Atelier Versace haute couture, eyewear, fragrances, watches, Palazzo Versace hotels, Versace Home homeware, and the Versace Jeans Couture youth line.

And we’ve dedicated ourselves to improving it for nearly 60 years. Ever since our founder, Dr. Amar Bose, bought a stereo system and thought, “I can make this better,” we’ve been relentlessly pushing forward to the next best thing. Innovation is more than what we do. It’s who we are — constantly learning and constantly curious. We never stop imagining what better sound sounds like. We’re music fanatics and audio engineers. We’re explorers and inventors and dreamers, passionate down to our bones about making whatever you’re listening to a little more magical.

At Bose, we are always dreaming up something better than what we created yesterday. See how we’ve contributed to the power of sound through the decades. 1929: It all begins. Amar Gopal Bose is born. Dr. Bose was born in Philadelphia to a Bengali father (Noni Gopal Bose) and a U.S.-born mother of English and German ancestry (Charlotte). 1956: Meet Dr. Bose. Amar earns his doctorate. Amar Bose graduates with a PhD in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and celebrates by buying himself a new hi-fi stereo system. But the sound quality disappoints him, and leads to him researching acoustics at MIT in his spare time. 1964: It’s on. Dr. Bose officially launches Bose Corporation. Dr. Bose launches Bose Corporation. By day, he and his two employees develop power-regulating systems for the military and other government agencies.

Through a relationship with an audio retailer in Bad Homburg, Germany, we begin selling Bose products outside the U.S. for the first time. 1986: Ready for takeoff. Our prototype noise cancelling headphones are co-pilots on a historic flight. Two of our active noise-reducing headsets preserve the hearing of pilots Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager on their record-breaking, non-stop, around-the-world voyager flight. 1987: We’re honored. Dr. Bose and Dr. William R. Short are named Inventors of the Year. Dr. Bose and Dr. William R. Short win the Intellectual Property Owners Education Foundation’s Inventor of the Year Award for a loudspeaker system employing a folded acoustic waveguide. 1993: Turn the dial. We reimagine radio with the Bose Wave. Our patented acoustic waveguide speaker technology redefines the concept of a radio by delivering rich, deep sound not previously heard from such a small unit. 2000: Redefining silence. Pioneering Bose technology changes the way people hear quiet. The QuietComfort® headphones forever change air travel for passengers by drastically reducing noise and providing better in-flight entertainment sound quality than ever before. 2008: A-list. Dr. Bose makes the National Inventors Hall of Fame. For achievements in audio technology that “have significantly influenced the quality of how we live,” Dr. Bose is inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. 2011: The gift.

17;"Multi Purpose Cleaner";"mission";"OUR STORY The story of Simple Green begins nearly 50 years ago, long before the world gave much thought to using eco-friendly products. Simple Green inventor and founder Bruce FaBrizio witnessed a fatal chemical accident while working alongside his father in the 1970s. This opened his eyes to the harmful health and environmental impacts of the dangerous toxic chemicals being used at that time. Bruce and his father knew there had to be a better way. Bruce developed the initial formula for Simple Green, an effective biodegradable* cleaning product that was safer for humans, animals, and the planet. Simple Green, the Original Green Cleaner was ahead of its time. Powerful enough for the commercial industry, yet safe enough to use at home. This formula decomposes into elements found in nature within six months after disposal into a typical sanitary sewer or septic system. FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS Bruce started off as a small, single-van operation selling Simple Green to remove tannic acid from coffee roasting machinery. He then expanded sales to automotive and industrial customers looking for a safe and effective way to remove grease and stains from equipment and flooring. From these humble beginnings, Bruce grew the Simple Green brand from a one-van show to a global enterprise. Following the death of his father in 1979, Bruce kept the dream alive and renamed the company Sunshine Makers, Inc. From there he introduced Simple Green to new markets and continued to grow and expand the Simple Green family of products to meet the cleaning needs of household, professional, and industrial customers. TO NEARLY 50 YEARS OF INTEGRITY & INNOVATION Our current product line includes more than 50 different innovative cleaning products for home and professional use. We are committed to doing our part to protect people and the planet, and will continue to develop new and innovative products that are responsible choices for generations to come. Sunshine Makers, Inc. is headquartered in Huntington Beach, CA with satellite offices all over the globe. Despite the company's extensive growth, its commitment to environmental responsibility and human safety remains unchanged. It is part of the core DNA of Simple Green and is reflected in everything we do. In the early 90's Bruce created the Environmental Technology Division dedicated to maintaining the company's cutting-edge position in safety and efficacy. The claims made by Simple Green have been proven repeatedly by independent laboratories and third-party testing facilities. In fact, many Simple Green products contain third-party certifications indicating their compliance with relevant health and safety standards. OUR MISSION We're committed to providing high-quality cleaning products with a focus on environmental responsibility and human safety. Since 1975, Simple Green has built a legacy of developing new and innovative products that are responsible choices for many generations to come."
18;"Multi Purpose Cleaner";"mission";"About Us From our garden-inspired scents to our garden-inspired values, we’re on a mission to grow something bigger. Uplifting scents, down-to-earth values. At Mrs. Meyer’s, we’ve always been inspired by the garden.​ From our uplifting scents to our down to earth values,​ we believe the garden can grow something bigger.​ So everything we do, from our hardworking products,​ to our responsibly sourced ingredients, to being a good neighbor, takes its cue from the goodness right in our own backyard.​ What we make For generations we've had to put up with conventional ingredients and sterile smells to get a good clean. To that we said, Enough is enough. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day: A collection of household products inspired by flowers and herbs that smell delightful, all while packing a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden-inspired scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil and many more. Spoiler alert: These products work hard and make every task, big or small, smell oh so wonderful. Rooted In Goodness Made with plant-derived ingredients, essential oils and other thoughtfully formulated ingredients, our products work hard against dirt and grime but they’re absolutely delightful to use. Our wonderful scents brighten days and bring all the loveliness of the garden inside. Because cleaning ought to inspire, energize and put smiles on our faces. If you ask us, at least. Learn more about our mission to grow sustainably. Garden-Inspired Scents Cruelty-Free Formula Made with Essential Oils & Other Thoughtfully Chosen Ingredients Recyclable Packaging (less pumps & caps) Smells like a garden. Cleans like the dickens. We work hard to ensure that our products are made with a responsible combination of ingredients—ingredients that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but fill your home with garden-inspired scents that smell delightful. We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, we obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy and olive. Keep in mind that sometimes we opt not to use a plant-derived material for reasons related to efficacy, consistency and safety. Our products are made without ammonia, chlorine, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates. All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from palm oil are members of Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices in eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America, like the Brazilian rain forests. Mrs. Meyer's products are made with cruelty-free formulas and are Leaping Bunny certified. Growing a More Compassionate World Here at Mrs. Meyer’s, we've always believed the garden has the power to do a whole lot more than inspire thoughtful home and personal care products: it can inspire thoughtfulness in people, too. Our roots in growing garden-inspired goodness are years in the making.​ Years ago we worked with horticulturalists at Ball Horticultural to create the Compassion Flower, a first-of-its-kind hybrid between the pansy (pensamiento in Spanish, which means 'to think of' or 'to consider') and the spreading viola. The result: a flower symbolizing that just like a plant, any act of kindness can grow and spread. Inspired by the cheery, uplifting scent of our new floral hybrid, we created our Compassion Flower product line to serve as a daily reminder that, just like washing your hands, practicing compassion and kindness is a good daily habit. Let's grow a more compassionate world. What good will the garden inspire in you? ​ Inspired by a Gardener We all have to clean; we ought to enjoy it. And we ought to make our homes smell fantastic while we’re at it."
19;"Multi Purpose Cleaner";"mission";"A MAN OF FEW WORDS, BUT MANY muscles. THE ORIGIN OF MR. CLEAN Where does a man so clean, with so many muscles, and such a bald head come from? Many stories have been told over the years. Some say he was a genie, others a sailor. But this is the story most often told. It was early one summer morning, when a farmer set out to tend his field, as he’d done every morning for more years than he could remember. But this wouldn’t be just another morning. Because it was on this morning that he looked down to find, cleaning his front steps, a small, sturdy baby, with a remarkably shiny, bald head. He was the cutest, cleanest baby the farmer and his wife had ever seen, and so they decided to adopt the little guy as their own. Mr. Clean learned to be the best at what you do, you need to work harder than everybody else. HARD WORK PAYS OFF Mr. Clean’s parents were hard working folks who lived by the motto “if somethings worth doing, it’s worth doing right”. It’s with that work ethic and his natural love for cleaning that Mr. Clean set out across the globe on a mission to become the best, toughest, hardest working cleaner in history. After years research Mr. Clean finally wrote The Encleanapedia, a chronicle of his adventures and everything he’d learned about cleaning. That book eventually found its way into the hands of a company called Procter and Gamble, who knew they’d found the man who would change the way people clean forever. For Mr. Clean, it was a dream come true. THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES Now as the face of his very own cleaning brand Mr. Clean embodies everything that makes his products so special. He’s tough, fearless, inventive, helpful, and has the muscle to knock out dirt, grease, and grime no matter where it’s hiding."

Today, we are leaning into our leadership and embedding sustainability as a fundamental part of our strategic development for a more responsible, net-positive future (across climate, nature, and people). Versace is accountable as a business, as a part of society, and as a collection of individuals forming part of the biodiversity that shares Planet Earth. At Versace, we’re putting into place processes and projects to reach this vision. Targets will be continually assessed to ensure they remain both ambitious and achievable. Together with our parent company, Capri Holdings—we are targeting meaningful change and we commit to remaining open and honest about our journey. Emmanuel Gintzburger, CEO Diversity, holistically Since our founding in 1978, diversity has been at the core of Versace. Diversity of people, thought, cultures, expression, and experience continues to be fundamental in making Versace the unique and forward-facing luxury House it is. Taking our values further, we have decided to expand this vision to biodiversity as a whole—to protect, nourish, and help flourish the diversity of all living things on earth—inclusive of all species and people. On our journey to being a more responsible company, in order to protect our planet and the communities living on it, biodiversity is at the core. As we embark on our new ambitious path, we will be sharing our vision, actions, and achievements with you. Our commitment At Versace, we are approaching responsible sourcing in a holistic way—considering the entire lifecycle of raw materials and striving to source those that have lower carbon footprints, use less water, create less waste, and support our efforts to protect biodiversity. At the same time, we are focused on positively impacting the people who interact with our products along the way. We monitor the portfolio of materials that we use in our collections and Atelier to ensure that we have continuous improvement around environmental impact, social responsibility, and animal welfare. Versace is committed to increasing the use of responsibly sourced materials and processes in its products, and we are taking ambitious steps to get there. We are proactively engaging within our supply chains to ensure rigorous social, ethical, and environmental standards are maintained. How we define responsible sourcing Sourcing that minimizes negative impact and strives to have a positive impact on people, nature, and the planet. We prioritize materials and processes that are traceable and backed up by third-party certifications to verify their positive credentials. Our current criteria include materials with the following certifications: Organically-produced materials: Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) Organic Content Standard (OCS) Pre- and post-consumer recycled materials: Global Recycled Standard (GRS) Recycled Claim Standard (RCS) Other responsible sourcing methods: Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) Responsible Down Standard (RDS) Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Leather Working Group (LWG), Silver or Gold tannery certifications Looking forward At Versace, we are designing and implementing creative solutions to facilitate the use of traceable, low-impact, responsibly sourced, and recyclable materials, across our products and collections. Through increasing supplier engagement, training, and upskilling internal teams on low-impact, responsible sourcing and design, we are laying the foundation for what’s to come. Our goal is to mainstream these materials within our collections. Policies and practices: We are committed to driving incremental positive impact on people, nature, and the planet beyond minimum compliance requirements. We developed a social responsibility program that ensures we are setting and maintaining a rigorous standard in our supply chain. Amongst this, we are committed to strengthening the labor protections of our artisans by routinely monitoring suppliers on topics including health and safety, welfare, fair pay, human rights, forced labor, and discrimination. We have restricted the use of certain high-impact and ethically challenging materials, like animal fur, for example. We have developed Responsible Sourcing Internal Guidance for our sourcing, product development, and design teams, to support them in making the most effective choices, daily. Our Sustainability, Communications, and Digital departments work closely together to ensure accurate information is presented for each of our products. We have improved and streamlined communications to enable accurate, effective communication with our stakeholders. We are tracking the percentage of responsibly-sourced styles in each of our collections—those containing over 50% responsibly sourced materials (as defined above) by weight, to benchmark our progress internally and guide improvements. We’ve embarked on a journey, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you."

4;"Fragrance";"sustainability";"Our Environmental Responsibility At VS&Co, we believe in doing what’s right in our industry, our community and our world. To drive our work forward, we are evaluating and setting quantifiable targets aligned to our most material environmental issues—greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, sustainable packaging and sustainable products— to hold ourselves accountable and measure our progress. We are also engaging with experts, academics, peers and industry associations to advance our efforts in partnership with the broader industry. Forest Products Victoria’s Secret & Co. is committed to responsible sourcing of forest products. Our Forest Products Procurement Policy is written to reduce threats to ancient and endangered forests and to avoid products that contribute to deforestation or human rights abuses. We are committed to working with our suppliers to source forest products from certified forestry operations, preferably those that meet Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards. Victoria’s Secret & Co. Forest Products Procurement Policy Paper In order to minimize our impact to the world's forests, we work with our suppliers to source paper products that include recycled content and/or are produced with pulp from certified forestry operations, preferably that meet FSC standards. Listed here is a summary of our commitments and the progress we've made. Victoria’s Secret & Co.’s Forest Products Policy: Addresses the entire paper and forest products lifecycle; and Eliminates suppliers sourcing from endangered forests. We are committed to: Not accepting paper sourced from endangered forests; Optimizing the use of FSC and Post-Consumer Waste (PCW) paper. To demonstrate our commitments, we: Phased out paper procured from endangered forests; and In partnership with L Brands, contributed more than $1 million for research and advocacy related to protecting endangered forests. Man-Made Cellulosic Fibers We are increasing the percentage of man-made cellulosic fibers in our portfolio, including rayon, viscose, modal and lyocell. We work with our suppliers in an effort to ensure that we do not knowingly source fabrics from old-growth or endangered forests or sources that contribute to deforestation or the loss of high conservation value forests. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (GHG) We recognize that the retail industry and its supply chain are significant contributors to climate change. How we manage impacts of climate change provides both a risk and opportunity for our organization. We are committed to understanding the impact of our products and operations throughout the entire value chain — from raw materials to end of life — to take meaningful action to reduce our footprint. In May 2022, we established a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Task Force — representative of key stakeholders in our facilities, sourcing, supply chain, logistics, operations, finance, audit, legal and ESG teams — to collect our 2021 GHG emissions inventory, understand climate risks and opportunities to our organization and to analyze our emissions across the value chain. Included in our 2023 ESG Report is our FY2022 emissions data, including Scopes 1, 2 and 3. This inventory represents the first full year of our operations as a standalone company. This data has been validated by a third-party auditor, Apex Companies, LLC (Apex). The verification declaration letter from Apex can be found here. VS&Co is wholly responsible for the determination and presentation of the following greenhouse gas emissions data. Addressing Emissions in our Supply Chain We regularly and proactively engage with our supply chain partners to understand their plans, progress and obstacles for reducing their emissions, and we encourage them to set their own targets. An important step in lowering the environmental impact of our products is collaborating with supply chain partners to improve manufacturing operations. Toward this aim, we are taking collective action with the Apparel Impact Institute’s Carbon Leadership Program (CLP). This program assists our supply chain partners in measuring their GHG emissions baseline, setting reduction targets, and creating a detailed roadmap for accomplishing those targets – and we’re proud to help sponsor them through this work. Helping to support our partners’ greenhouse gas reduction strategies is key to reducing the environmental footprint of our value chain. TRANSPORTATION The movement of freight around the world requires the use of fossil fuels, and we work with some of the leading logistics companies in the world to efficiently transport our goods using a variety of means. In order to minimize the impact of our supply chain logistics on the environment, Victoria’s Secret & Co. is committed to: Utilizing the most efficient means of transportation that meets our delivery needs and schedules; and Utilizing highly efficient trailer stacking techniques to optimize the use of trailer space and reduce the number of trucks and amount of energy required to transport our merchandise to our distribution centers. BEAUTY SUPPLY CHAIN We have longstanding partnerships with our beauty vendors with many located on one campus, the Beauty Park, in New Albany, Ohio. Over 40% of our finished goods and components are produced within the Beauty Park. As of today, the 200-acre site is the home of 14 inter-connected personal care and beauty product vendors, including: personal care and beauty product manufacturers packaging component manufacturers, product fillers packaging companies By vertically integrating the entire personal care product supply chain from beginning to end, Victoria’s Secret & Co. is able to shave both time (both production and transit time) as well as distance from our production process. Additionally, the reduction in the transit distance reduces the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacture of our products. PARTNERING TOWARD IMPROVEMENT We’re especially proud to partner with suppliers that share our values and commitment to our community and the environment through responsible manufacturing practices. Brandix Group is another Victoria’s Secret & Co. partner that shares our values and demonstrates a deep commitment to the environment. Through its support of the Green Building Council’s “Go Green” Campaign where it has manufacturing operations in Sri Lanka, Brandix is dedicated to raising awareness on the importance of environment protection and sustainable, practical solutions. Consistent with this commitment to environmental sustainability, Brandix built the first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum-rated apparel factory under the Green Building Rating System of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and obtained LEED certification for three additional facilities. In addition, Brandix installed the largest rooftop solar plant in Sri Lanka as part of their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. By developing its own assessment tool - Eco Index, Brandix is able to quantify reductions in key environmental indicators for air, water and earth as they rollout initiatives to all of their locations in an effort to minimise CO2 emissions, energy and water consumption and solid waste disposal. We’re also thrilled to highlight our partner, MAS Holdings. Our unique partnership with MAS Holdings has led to groundbreaking progress on the Forever Bra, which features our first bra pad designed for circularity. For over three decades, MAS has set out to reimagine the way the industry approaches manufacturing. At its core, MAS is committed to inspiring sustainable change in a way that works toward climate resilience, enriches lives and drives innovation that fuels positive change. Packaging Packaging is critical for protecting and transporting our product, as well as supporting our customer’s shopping experience. We recognize, however, that packaging is a significant contributor to our waste generation and emissions. With a comprehensive view of our impact levers, we aligned on principles to guide our packaging sustainability strategy and established a target to hold ourselves accountable and track progress. Our first priority is to eliminate unnecessary packaging. For essential packaging, we focus on five principles to improve our environmental impact: weight-optimized, mono-material, fully recyclable, reusable and free of virgin content. By 2030, our goal is for 75% or more of packaging across all packaging categories to be designed with at least one eco-design principle and use at least 50% PCR. We also joined the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, an industry group to continue learning from others, share our learnings and collaborate with peers to drive action. Packaging Reduction and Optimization We are continually researching and testing new packaging options that reduce the amount of packaging components and materials required to produce, ship, protect and dispense our product. Here are examples of our process to date: Implemented rolling techniques for bulky products at the vendor to reduce the amount of corrugate needed and improved transportation efficiency by allowing for more products to be shipped in the same space. Reduced the amount and bulk of packaging used to house and ship e-commerce orders, helping to eliminate unnecessary components while maintaining high quality for transportation. Increased manufacturing efficiency, and in turn, reduced the number of components that are produced as scrap. Reduced weight of primary beauty packaging. Design for Recovery and Recyclability We are committed to evaluating packaging options with their end-of-life destination in mind, to reduce our contribution to packaging waste, where possible. In partnership with our suppliers, we continue to explore packaging options that are designed to be recycled or reused. Here is an update on our work underway: What we’re doing: Decreasing virgin content and increasing recycled content. Why: This supports the circular economy, keeping materials in use for longer. When recycled materials are not available due to supply chain or product durability issues, we prioritize using certified alternative materials (i.e., Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper). What we’re doing: Designing mono-material packaging. Why: Packaging composed of at least 90% of the same material can better enable recycling options at end-of-life. What we’re doing: Designing our packaging to be recyclable. Why: Utilizing materials that are compatible with current recycling systems globally, as well as designing packaging to be separable at its end-of-life, are the first steps to contributing to a circular economy. What we’re doing: Optimizing the weight of our packaging. Why: Eliminating unnecessary packaging components, consolidating packaging items where possible and light-weighting essential packaging products are key to minimizing the overall environmental impact of our packaging. What we’re doing: Designing our packaging to be reusable. Why: Reuse allows packaging to stay in use longer and reduces our packaging needs. Water and Chemical Management At Victoria’s Secret & Co. (VS&Co) we recognize that our planet is our greatest asset, and we are committed to reducing our footprint across our supply chain by working closely with industry groups and our suppliers to institute best practices in environment management. As part of this commitment, we’re proud to partner with several industry-leading organizations like, Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) to help us reduce water and energy consumption and waste generation, the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemical (ZDHC) and Apparel and Footwear RSL Management (AFIRM) groups to help us improve chemical management and eliminate pollution discharge and Textile Exchange to help us improve the sustainability of our materials."

Driving Positive Change See the progress we've already made and the steps we're taking to reach our goals for a healthier planet. Packaging and Plastics We are changing the way we approach the packaging in our products. This involves not only identifying sustainable packaging solutions, but also ensuring the quality and durability our customers depend on. A key consideration also included in our approach will be communication with customers about how to properly dispose of our packaging. This will take significant work, but we are committed to meeting the challenge head-on. Better Packaging on the Horizon We are building on our current work to reduce the footprint of our packaging using 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging across our product portfolio by 2030, with a near-term focus on embracing circular packaging solutions to decrease the use of virgin plastic. By increasing our use of post-consumer resin instead of virgin plastic, we can reduce the amount of plastic that goes to landfill, reduce fossil fuels usage in the manufacturing of new plastic products and support recycling programs. All of these actions will help us achieve our sustainability goals and limit negative impact on the environment. We’re proud of the progress we made in 2023 against our packaging and plastics commitments, including: Incorporating ESG into supplier conversations and exploring opportunities for PCR and post industrial recycled (PIR) materials where possible. Seizing opportunities to introduce PCR at various levels into the primary packaging for new products, like with the launch of our new laundry care collection. Exploring refillable product expansion in the future. Retaining external expertise to better understand the evolving regulatory/legislative landscape related to packaging and plastics and have thought partnership in the development of forward-looking strategies to meet/exceed these requirements where applicable. Conducting an end-to-end recyclability assessment with Resource Recycling Systems (RRS) on our five key product forms, which was used to influence the action plan in our ESG roadmap for packaging and plastics commitments.

Climate Change and Carbon Emissions As a global business, we recognize the role we can play in helping to combat climate change. We are committed to taking significant steps forward to measure and make reductions on the emissions stemming from our operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and within our entire value chain (Scope 3). Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions While our Scope 1 and 2 emissions are a small portion of our carbon footprint, we are committed to achieving emissions reductions in activities that fall within the realm of our direct control. As we work to achieve 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030, our teams are continuing to identify and pursue opportunities to be more efficient with energy and fuel use. Scope 3 Emissions and CDP Climate Reporting We estimate that the bulk of our emissions stem from our extended value chain (Scope 3). That's why we have reported several categories of our indirect emissions (Scope 3) to CDP since the mid-2000s (as part of L Brands until 2021) and are expanding measurement to all relevant Scope 3 emissions categories in alignment with our commitment to set reduction targets for our entire value chain by 2025. Sustainable Sourcing Every step of the product’s journey matters as we work to create a brighter and happier planet. We are committed to working toward ensuring that our materials are sourced in a way that reduces the environmental impact where possible. Sourcing Sustainable Paper We’re proud to continue our commitment to the sustainable sourcing of paper and other forest product supplies, such as cardboard. In line with our Forest Products Procurement Policy, we diligently endeavor to avoid products that contribute to deforestation or human rights abuses. We look forward to continuing our efforts to introduce recyclable paper solutions and identify further opportunities to reduce paper consumption where appropriate. Waste and Water Management It's important to us to be good stewards of the environment and good neighbors in our communities around the world. We're committed to preserving resources for future generations – and as such, we carefully review our operations for safety and compliance and look for ways to reuse materials or do more with less. Waste and Recycling We follow strict standard operating procedures and policies for the management of waste to ensure safe and compliant recycling, transport and disposal. This includes waste generated by our operations in offices, distribution and fulfillment centers and stores as well as company-owned inventory (e.g., packaging components, etc.) at third-party vendors when and where it requires disposal. Where we have direct control, we work with an extensive network of recycling and disposal partners while some stores’ waste and recycling services are managed by vendors contracted directly through our mall landlords. We also continuously work with our teams and external recycling partners to identify economically viable outlets to reuse and recycle the materials from our operations. Water We recognize the significance of water as a natural resource and the critical need to safeguard it. As a business, we interact with water in a variety of ways. At our own operations, it’s part of our environmental footprint as we use water in our field stores and home offices (in bathrooms, demonstration sinks, kitchens, chillers, etc.). We also use water as an ingredient in products, and, through our sustainable sourcing risk assessment tool, identified it as one of our priority ingredients as we work to focus our sustainable sourcing strategy in the future. In 2023, we took initial steps to set the foundation for our future water program. We partnered with EDF to conduct a water assessment and measure our direct water usage footprint. Overall, the findings validated that a majority of our direct and ingredient water use is in and around Columbus, Ohio, the water basins of which are considered ‘Medium to High’ Baseline Water Stress according to the WRI’s Aqueduct tool. While our central business functions are not located in a water-scarce part of the country, some of our stores and fillers are. We now have our baseline to reference as we build a more robust water program in the future. As we look ahead, we will continue our assessment of water interactions and look forward to solidifying our water strategy in the near future. Good360 Partnership Impact We piloted a new initiative in 2023 for seasonal products in our stores that are marked-out-of-stock (products unable to be sold to customers, e.g., end of season products). Through engagement with our associates around our new ESG strategy, we identified an opportunity to reduce our environmental impact while simultaneously creating positive social impact by donating these products to local nonprofits. A cross-functional team worked to develop, align and execute a pilot as proof-of-concept to collect, transport and donate this product to local nonprofits.

We pledge to fulfill our environmental responsibilities and contribute through our technology. TOPICS All-round consideration for the environment Detail about environmental features in headphones A sound environmental plan Our headphones are engineered for high-quality design and sound, and also with the environment in mind. Under our Green Management 2025 environmental targets, Sony continues to pursue environmentally conscious development of both products and packaging. Development of recycled plastics Challenges with recycled materials Plastic materials for recycling are typically painted or colored, making them unsuitable for use in decorative parts. In order to solve this problem, we procure unpigmented industrial scrap from automobile parts, which we can precisely sort to color and use in a wide range of parts. Features of recycled plastics Starting with unpigmented pellets minimises the additives required in the coloring process. This enables the use of more than 85%1recycled material in our plastics, and up to a remarkable 98% for black materials. Expanding recycling throughout our range For the first time in the history of our headphones, Sony has successfully introduced recycled plastic materials into body parts of new models (WH-1000XM53, LinkBuds4 and LinkBuds S4). And we're just getting started, with much more use of recycled plastic planned in our headphones going forward. Sustainable packaging Our campaign for sustainable packaging includes several new and current initiatives. Toward early achievement of our target The Green Management 2025 initiative targets the total elimination of plastic from the packaging of newly designed small products by 2025. With each new headphone design from Sony, we are expanding our use of sustainable packaging materials, and striving to achieve this goal in advance of the target year. Sustainable paper materials We continue to advance the adoption of Sony’s proprietary sustainable paper, Original Blended Material, for the packaging of our flagship headphone model, the 1000X series (the WF-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5). Original Blended Material is a sustainable paper material made from bamboo, sugarcane fibres, and post-consumer recycled paper. Introducing the packaging for the WF-1000XM4 and the WH-1000XM5 Existing products are no exception As part of our wide-ranging renewal efforts, we are changing the outer packaging of existing models from plastic to paper. In particular, the outer packaging of the MDR-EX15AP has been redesigned to reduce total plastic usage by more than 90%, from approximately 96%5 to less than 5%. Less plastic, for easier recycling The individual carton design previously used PP6 (plastic) lamination which prevented recycling. This has been replaced with an abrasion-resistant varnish that allows the carton to be recycled7. [1] Process of PP lamination of paper surface [2] Applying UV8 varnish with print technology Interview Makoto Kawabata Sony Corporation, Home Entertainment & Sound Products Business Group, Mobile Product Business Division, Mobile Product Mechanical Design Department Under its Road to Zero environmental plan, the Sony Group aims to minimise resource inputs, and has been pursuing the introduction of recycled materials in its home audio and other products for some time. However, in the case of ABS, the plastic mainly used in headphones, the lack of a recycled material on the market with high quality and a high recycled ratio has slowed the introduction of recycled materials. Therefore, we decided to develop a recycled ABS that is easy to use and has a high recycled content. In cooperation with partner companies, we have newly developed a recycled ABS that allows a variety of coloring without the addition of virgin plastic by precisely sorting unpigmented ABS scrap material by color. With LinkBuds, we tried to create a delicate appearance comparable to virgin ABS, which was difficult to achieve with conventional recycled ABS. We have begun to introduce this recycled ABS in many headphone models. We will continue to take on further challenges in line with the Road to Zero plan. Mio Nakanishi Sony Corporation, Home Entertainment & Sound Products Business Group, Mobile Product Business Division, Mobile Product Planning Department Sony is making changes to its headphones, both new models and products already on the market, with the aim of eliminating all plastic from their packaging. To reduce the amount of plastic used in packaging to zero across the board is not an easy task, as it is costly and the role of packaging differs depending on product characteristics, sales conditions, and customers. However, we believe that we were able to create packaging responsive to environmental considerations without compromising on functionality or appeal precisely because Sony has kept environmental considerations in mind from the initial stages of product creation. The new WH-1000XM5 model introduces Sony's proprietary paper Original Blended Material for the product box, and is the first model to carry the Original Blended Material logo. The design has been changed considerably from the previous WH-1000XM4 model, with the package designed to convey increased consideration for the environment. We believe that for the cycle of sustainability to be realised, as well as creating products, of course, it’s also necessary to get customers to recycle those products to close the cycle. We will continue, while manufacturing products, to always consider what kind of products are appropriate to make for the planet."
12;"Wireless Headphones";"sustainability";"Apple 2030 A plan as innovative as our products. We are committed to protecting the planet. And designing products you love. Apple 2030 is our plan to do both. By focusing on recycled and renewable materials, clean electricity and low-carbon shipping, we’re working to bring our net emissions to zero across our entire carbon footprint. We’re sharing our progress — and the work that remains — so you can join us on this journey. A detailed approach. From design to disassembly. Design and Source Design our products with recycled and renewable materials.1 Our Approach Recycled and renewable materials often carry a lighter footprint than mined materials. By sourcing more recycled and renewable content, we can help to one day end our reliance on mining. Our Progress 22% of the materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled and renewable sources.2 Make Source all manufacturing electricity from clean energy. Our Approach Most of our carbon footprint comes from the electricity used to manufacture our products. So our suppliers are transitioning to electricity generated from solar, wind and other renewable sources. Our Progress Over 320 of our suppliers have already committed to using 100% renewable electricity by 2030.3 Package and Ship Package and ship our products with less emissions. Our Approach We’re eliminating plastic from our packaging and making it more compact.4 And we’re prioritizing low-carbon shipping methods such as ocean, rail and electric vehicles. Our Progress More than 97% of our packaging is now fibre-based.5 Use Match 100% of our products’ energy use with clean electricity.6 Our Approach We’re investing in global renewable energy projects that help address the electricity our products use. And we’re making these devices even more energy-efficient. Our Progress We’re matching 100% of the expected electricity use for Apple Watch models by investing in projects like the IP Radian Solar project.7 Recover Maximize the materials we recover from recycled products. Our Approach We’re creating technologies, such as our disassembly robot Daisy, to recover critical materials so they can be recycled and reused.8 Our Progress In 2023, we recycled nearly 40,000 metric tons of electronic materials.9 Our progress by the numbers. We introduced our most significant product emissions reductions to date with the 2023 Apple Watch lineup.

We believe all things should be Rooted in Goodness™ and we strive to be honest, informative, and authentic in how we show up. We know every choice we make today, from how we source ingredients to how we package our products, matters. And it’s these choices that can positively impact the world around us. You'll find our belief—to take only what you need and make do with what you have—sown throughout our products and practices. It’s the guiding principle for our sustainability goals and mission to help grow a more compassionate world. Ingredients Thoughtfully-Picked We’re mindful throughout our formula development process, from how our ingredients are sourced to how they break down. When selecting our ingredients, we work closely with our suppliers to ensure our raw materials are sourced responsibly. We’re also conscious of our products leaving as minimal of a footprint as possible. We test all our down-the drain formulas for biodegradability – how well a material can break down when it interacts with the environment. We know our products live beyond their use in your home, so we’re mindful of where they go after. And this is something we take to heart, in more ways than one: We have no added forever chemicals (PFAS) in our products. All our products that go down the drain meet the widely accepted European OECD standards for biodegradability. In partnership with our parent company, SC Johnson, we’ve developed internal standards for making biodegradability claims that exceed even the OECD standards. Many of our fragrances leverage a component of upcycled ingredients (like cedarwood oil). Our palm oil is responsibly sourced and RSPO-certified. We aim to eventually leave palm oil in the past, and and only use ingredients that don’t lead to deforestation or negatively impact biodiversity.

Packaging Crafted With Care We’ve always been about down-to-earth honesty. And the truth is, not everything that seems recyclable can be recycled. Many aspects of packaging contaminate the stream at recycling facilities, making the entire product unrecyclable. And to us, that’s a shame. We know we have a responsibility to minimize our impact by maintaining recyclability standards. That’s why we’re working to create products with their end of life in mind through: Innovating new, reusable formats to give you better alternatives to single-use plastic. Offering concentrated formulas that require less water and prolonged container lifespan. Durable and refillable products that you can use repeatedly and then recycled. mrs meyers household cleaning products and body care products There’s Still Room To Grow We acknowledge that plastic is part of our everyday life and while it can have many benefits—like reducing food waste and creating life-saving medical treatments—the overuse of single-use plastic has become a global crisis and we’re committed to doing our part to address it. We’ve got our sleeves rolled up and are dedicated to reducing our own plastic waste footprint by offering more sustainable and recyclable plastic and non-plastic options across our entire portfolio. There are certain practices we’re working on, like removing black plastic in our products. That’s because black plastic bypasses the recycling system and goes straight into the landfill. We’ve started to remove black plastic from our laundry and home cleaning and aim to do this across our entire product line by 2026. We’re also committed to moving away from other unsustainable materials and practices and toward: Refillable options for best-selling products like our Hand Soap, Dish Soap, and Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaners. Pumps and triggers for our bottles without metal springs to increase recyclability. Maximizing the PCR (post-consumer recycled) content across all our existing plastic bottles. Manufacturing Doing More With Less The majority of our products, including Hand Soap, Dish Soap, and Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaners, are manufactured in a LEED-platinum certified factory, and outside its walls, we share a deep connection to the surrounding South Side Chicago community. We invest in the neighboring land to grow greener, more biodiverse spaces for gardens to thrive. As well as: Creating jobs for local residents in South Side Chicago. Using natural lighting to save on electricity. Utilizing super-efficient delivery trucks that run on a minimum of 20% biodiesel. Conserving 30 million gallons of water over 5 years. Partnering with local non-profit organization, Emerald South Economic Development Collaborative, to invest in transforming vacant land in the mid-South Side of Chicago into green spaces that promote positive outcomes for the surrounding community. Supporting local leaders via our Lots of Compassion initiative which provides garden grants to those looking to build community gardens in their own backyard. With all this in mind, we’re committed to growing in harmony with the world around us and leaving the world a little better than we found it. We’ll continue to bring you along on our journey with honesty, transparency, and the responsibility to be a good neighbor. As a garden-inspired brand, we believe the act of gardening is about so much more than creating beauty, it reinforces our deeply rooted belief that all living things are connected.

We're constantly measuring the impact of our actions, to make sure we stay on track and are having a real, tangible impact on people's lives. See our latest performance 29.6% net revenue from more sustainable products 67% reduction in absolute carbon emissions in our operations since 2015 100% zero waste to landfill from our factories £31M social impact investment Focusing on what matters most We're focusing on the social and environmental issues that matter most to people within our company and beyond – from customers, consumers and communities, to our investors, suppliers and employees. Identifying the world's most pressing issues and our company’s biggest impacts shapes our strategy, policies and communications, so we can make as big a difference as we can. Purpose-led brands We're using the power and reach of our brands, products, programmes and partnerships to have the biggest possible impact on the world's most urgent social and environmental challenges. Our approach Healthier planet Recognising the connection between healthy people and a healthy planet, we’re battling climate change by protecting biodiversity, using water more efficiently and cutting our carbon footprint. Fairer society We're using our position as an employer, as well as our relationship with our partners and suppliers, to build a fairer, more inclusive society for the people we work with across the globe. OUR GOVERNANCE Our approach is underpinned by high standards of corporate governance, combined with a rigorous, open approach to reporting. It's how we run our business with integrity and maintain people's trust. FOCUSING ON WHAT MATTERS For our sustainability strategy to be a success, it is important that we focus on the most material issues to the company and stakeholders. We work with independent external experts to assess the priority issues for our many stakeholders through focused research and dialogue. This helps us understand how to allocate resources and partner for the maximum impact, as well as how to shape our culture to make a real difference in the areas that matter most. Our starting point in addressing sustainability is establishing what matters most to both internal and external stakeholders, from customers, consumers and communities, to investors, suppliers and employees. Our latest materiality assessment results reaffirm the ambitions and associated targets we set in 2021 – purpose-led brands, a healthier planet, and a fairer, more inclusive and diverse society – are relevant to all stakeholders and that our priorities match theirs. They tell us we’re prioritising the right issues: there’s a clear connection between our most material issues, our 2030 ambitions and our business strategy. BRANDS WITH PURPOSE We aim to use the reach and power of our brands and our business as a force for good. Our brands are all focused on solving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, so we have as positive an impact on society as possible, while minimising our impact on the environment. We're dedicated to improving people’s lives through better hygiene, health and nutrition.
