Guys, it's Mr. Allen C here, and today we're checking out Mr. Clean Multi-Surface Cleaner, and it says Febreze Freshness inside. So this is a multi-surface cleaner, and you can see we've been using it. It smells great, and it cuts through grease, powerful cleaning, helps eliminate odors, safe on hardwood.

So pretty much what we do is we pour a little in a bucket, dilute it with some water, and then wipe down our surfaces, and then instead of being icky, everything's clean and smells good. So again, that's Mr. Clean with Febreze.

And I hope you guys enjoyed the video. Thanks for checking it out. Let's see if there's anything special with this cap. My wife would know, but I'm not sure. Let's take it off. Nope, just a standard cap. Looks like it's just really bubbly. Once again, smells very good. Thanks for checking out the video. Have a great day.
