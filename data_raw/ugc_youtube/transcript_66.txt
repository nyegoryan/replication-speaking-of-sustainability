I had to stop Seb because he was in the middle of cleaning our air conditioning filters, and they were full of obviously dust but also mold, which was kind of shocking and scary. So he cleaned the first one already, and I was absolutely shocked at the outcome and wanted to show you how amazing it looks after a good clean. So this is clearly the before, and here he is scrubbing. And check out this after. Look how beautiful that is, and all because of the pink stuff.
