Hey, what's up everyone? Welcome back to another video, and today we're going to take a look at the AirPods. Let's go! The second generation of the AirPods looks almost identical to the original generation of the AirPods, with a now iconic clean, minimalistic, and sleek design. The AirPods are also designed to be comfortable and secure, with a universal fit that should work for most people. They sit securely in place without feeling too heavy or bulky, although to some people this might not be the case. The white plastic ear tips stay in your ears, but they don't create an in-ear seal. This means that there's no noise cancellation whatsoever, and you will instantly notice it.

One design flaw of the AirPods is that they don't have any physical buttons or controls. Instead, you have to tap on the AirPods to control playback and access other features. While this can take some time getting used to if it's your first time using AirPods, it's only a minor inconvenience once you're familiar with it. Gesture controls and volume control are very, very noticeably missing.

The AirPods come with the H1 chip, and Apple says that the H1 chip has been specifically designed for headphones and enables most of the AirPods' features. Instead of having to double-tap one of the AirPods to launch Siri, you can say, "Hey Siri," to activate it. But even with the H1 chip and hands-free ability, there's still a very noticeable delay from when you say, "Hey Siri," to getting a response. And unlike the iPhone, there's no sound to indicate that Siri has been activated, and because of this, you can easily end up repeating yourself because it's hard to know if Siri hears your command. To be perfectly honest, I ended up passing entirely on the whole Siri experience on the AirPods a long time ago.

If you have an iOS device or a Mac, this is one area where Apple has a complete advantage over the competition. Pairing your iPhone or iPad will instantly recognize the AirPods as soon as you open the case and display an on-screen prompt asking if you want to connect them. You can still also switch very easily from one device to another. The AirPods are also compatible with Android devices, although you will miss out on some features without an Apple device.

The sound quality of the AirPods is not great, but it is good. The sound is clear, full, and detailed without overwhelming bass and annoying highs. The lack of noise cancellation can be very frustrating, especially when you're in places like a subway or a plane or the street. On the upside, this makes the AirPods blend entirely into your environment, so it's very easy to forget that you're wearing them.

One of the benefits of the AirPods is their ability to deliver a relatively wide soundstage, which creates a sense of space and dimensionality in the music. This is particularly impressive for a pair of ear pods that sit inside your ear canal. The AirPods also feature adaptive EQ, which automatically adjusts the sound signature based on the shape of your ear and the fit of the earbuds. This can help improve the overall sound quality and balance, especially if you have a unique ear shape or size.

The AirPods' dual microphone array offers better than average call quality with a clear, natural-sounding voice transmission. The audio is crisp, and the mics tend to sound closer than most competing true wireless mics do. Overall, the AirPods provide good sound quality and great performance during calls.

The battery life on the AirPods is decent. I get close to 5 hours of audio playback or 3 hours of talk time on a single charge. However, the case still holds another 24 hours worth of battery, so that's good. If you happen to run out of battery, you can do a quick charge and still get plenty of power. Fifteen minutes of charging can get you roughly 3 hours of playback, so that's good. The AirPods case comes in two different models. One supports wireless charging, and the other can be charged only through the lightning cable. For most people, the battery life on the AirPods should be more than enough for a whole day of use on a single charge.

Now, the big question: Are the AirPods second generation worth buying? That depends on your priorities. These might not have the latest bells and whistles, but they offer a very solid package for a lower price than the AirPods Pro or the AirPods Max. The second generation of the AirPods holds up extremely well to this day with good audio quality, good battery life, and seamless connectivity with all your Apple devices. So for the casual user who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on true wireless earbuds, these are perfect. They're super affordable, super easy to use, have good sound, good battery life, and I think they still look great if that's important to you.

Of course, there are some setbacks: lack of noise cancellation, which is a fantastic feature that can be very, very helpful to your hearing health, and the fact that some people cannot physically use them because of the form factor. But for the casual user that can use them, these won't be a deal-breaker. So if you're not looking for the latest and the greatest features and prefer a more affordable option that still delivers great performance and the unmistakable Apple experience, these are a fantastic choice. I mean, I have them and I use them every single day, and they're still good.
