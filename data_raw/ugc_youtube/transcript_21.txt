Hello everyone and welcome back to my channel. In today's video, I'm gonna be doing a review on the Yankee Candle of Pink Sands. So let's get right into this review.

One of the reasons why I purchased this candle was, first of all, I am a Yankee Candle fanatic. My wife and I love the Yankee Candle brand; we love the different scents and aromas they have. I just picked this one up for Mother's Day for her. This is actually the 13-ounce jar. This is the Pink Sands, like I said earlier. This is the double wick here, so as you can see, it has two double wicks here, and I have to tell you that the smell is just so wonderful. It has a great scent to it. It makes your room smell super good, and this particular candle smells like a fruity melon type. So it's a very nice smell, and it's definitely something that you can use for a long time.

It comes, like I said, with two wicks, and these are very high quality. When you're burning the candle, both melt at the same time, and you can use this for hours long. It's going to make your whole room smell good. So let me go ahead and just demonstrate to you how it's going to look. Okay, so I got my little electric lighter here, so I'm going to go ahead and light this side up here. Go ahead and light the other side. And there we have it.

Like I said, I am a Yankee Candle fanatic, and this Pink Sands is just a super wonderful smell. It's a great gift for a friend or a mother or whoever likes candles. It's going to have your whole room smelling nice, fruity, melon type of citrus, and this is definitely a candle that I recommend. It never lets me down, and I just love it because, like I said, the wicks burn evenly and it just starts off right away with an amazing smell. So I highly recommend it. Thank you for watching this review, and I will see you in the next video.
