Hi, guys. I want to show you another one of my favorite cleaners. This one is the Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Multi-Surface Concentrate. What I love about this cleaner is, first of all, it's concentrated. So I do have my little one that I got at the grocery store, and what I do is I take my refills, put it inside, mix it with some water, and I have a whole other bottle of cleaner, which is great. Another reason why I love this is the smell. This one is the Lemon Verbena. It has kind of a mild citrus scent, which smells so good when you're washing your floors, your countertops, anything like that. It's biodegradable; it has 98% natural cleaners in it, which is great. It makes your place smell amazing. It's safe on hardwood, tiles, countertops, walls. Just a great product. But that's just our point of view.
