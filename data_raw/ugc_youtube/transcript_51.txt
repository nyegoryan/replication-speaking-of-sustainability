Hello, everyone, and welcome back to my channel. In today's video, I'm going to be doing a review on Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner. Now, as you may know, the Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner is a very safe choice for your cleaning purposes, especially if you are allergic or have a bad reaction to bleach or ammonia. 

Simple Green is biodegradable. You can use it on your baby chair, on your kitchen floor, in your kitchen cabinets—like I said, it's all-purpose. It's definitely concentrated just for all-purpose use. Another reason why we like it is because we have a baby seat and a baby eating table, and we just don't trust using the other types of all-purpose cleaners because of the chemicals inside of them. 

What we have here is the standard bottle. It has 22 ounces and cleans super well. As you can see right here, I have a nice little dirty table. So, I'm going to go ahead and wipe it down and spray it. If you really want a biodegradable, very good all-purpose cleaner, then Simple Green is just what you're looking for. 

We use Simple Green all the time, and I wouldn't say that Simple Green is better than Lysol or any other brand, but it gets the job done. It is definitely safe and healthy for your family. We even have our kids using Simple Green. They go in their bathroom and clean their own bathroom and toilet because we know that this is a safe product. As you see in the back, there are different versions of this. You have the heavy-duty purpose, and this bottle already comes concentrated, so you don't have to do any mixing or anything like that.

I hope you like this review. Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner is definitely strong and powerful. It will clean up dirt, grease, and grime. You can use it on your brakes and for multi-purposes. Thank you for watching this review.
