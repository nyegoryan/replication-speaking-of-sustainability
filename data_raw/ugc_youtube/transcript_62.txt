What's up, guys? This is the Lysol All-Purpose Cleaner. This is the Lemon Breeze scent. We absolutely love this in my house. We use it everywhere. You check out the back; it tells you that you can use it in the kitchen, in the bathroom. I mean, we use this in our toilets, we use this in our sinks, in the shower. We absolutely love the scent. There's just something about that lemon fresh scent that really makes you, you know, know that it's clean.

And then there's three different ways you can use it. So you can clean, you just spray it on, wipe it right off. You can sanitize, where you spray it on, let it sit for 10 seconds, and then you wipe it off. Or disinfect, which is what we do to our kitchen sink after we, you know, cook with different raw meats and things like that. We spray it, leave it for two minutes, and then you wipe it. That'll disinfect the surfaces really good. So all in all, you know, great product. We love the scent. It's a classic scent. Really can't go wrong with it. So check it out.
