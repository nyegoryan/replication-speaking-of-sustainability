Hey guys, so I'm here with a perfume review. I just got the opportunity to try Versace Bright Crystal. You can see this is just like a beautiful bottle already. So if you're looking for a really great gift for someone who is into a fruity, floral, musky scent, Versace Bright Crystal is the way to go. I actually personally love this smell. This fragrance is so, so good. It has all different types of flowers in it. It is a very, very light scent. As with fragrances, you spray it on, it smells different on everyone.

This product, if you have someone in your family, friends, co-workers that you're going to be gifting for this holiday season, this is an amazing, amazing perfume. It is, like I said before, very florally but it’s very light. It's not going to give you a headache. It's not too strong. And nothing says luxury like this bottle right here. I mean, the cap is just stunning. The bottle is beautiful. This is the 1.7 ounces of the Versace Bright Crystal and it's, I think personally, a really, really great gift for anybody who loves more of a florally, musky type of fragrance. So definitely check it out. Check it out on my Macy's store. And I hope you enjoyed my perfume review.
