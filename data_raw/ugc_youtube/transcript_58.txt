Hi, my name is Peter Simon, and today I will be reviewing Mr. Clean All-Purpose Cleaner with Febreze Freshness.

As you can see here, we have a bunch of dirt on the ground, and that's kind of gross, so we're going to clean it up with this nice-smelling, because of the Febreze, Mr. Clean product. A little bit of the diluted multi-purpose cleaner, you can see that all the dirt just comes right up, and you can actually see the residue of the dirt on the paper towel itself.

After everything has been wiped and dried, you can see that there is no longer any dirt anywhere on the ground, and in fact, all of it is right here on these paper towels. And it smells pretty good too. All in all, I'd say this is one of the best multi-purpose cleaners I've used. Not only does it leave behind a good smell, but it also really cleans the surfaces. 

Take my word for it. The only issues that I could find with this product are that it's a little hard to get a hold of, which may give merit to the fact that it's a very good product because people are buying it up. Or some people may not have as ecstatic reviews of it as I do. So, aside from the fact that I had to travel all around Atlanta to find this product, I'd say it's a very, very good multi-purpose cleaner. I definitely give this about four and a half stars.

Thank you for watching my review. I'm Peter Simon, and this has been the Mr. Clean Multi-Purpose Cleaner with Febreze.
