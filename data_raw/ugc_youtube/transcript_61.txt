And here I have Lysol All-Purpose Cleaner. I just wanted to show you quick. Kills 99% of bacteria, 99.9% kills germs. Tested and proven to kill COVID-19 virus. This is a really good all-purpose cleaner, and it has a great lemon breeze scent.

So anyway, I want to spray some of this on this paper towel here and just show you a little bit about what you can bring up because sometimes when you clean, you don't actually know if you're getting anything or if you think a surface is already clean. You may not think so, but check that out right there, okay? 

So you can also use this over on your wood table or your seats, anything like that, and we're gonna just clean that up. You can already see all the nice lemon scent as well. Good for cleaning chairs and tables and high chairs, anything like that, but you can also use it on your sink as well. 

So if you want to shine that sink up a little bit better, easily put some lemon scent in there and rinse it down. Put that lemon scent down in that disposal as well to freshen up that InSinkErator. That is for the Lysol All-Purpose Cleaner.
