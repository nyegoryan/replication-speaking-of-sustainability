Today, I'm reviewing this Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner. Now, this one is specifically ready to use, and that's important to check. They do also sell concentrates that you can mix, so just be sure and check before you use it if you're purchasing the concentrate or the ready-to-use option. It should say on the packaging. Typically, the ready-to-use will have the spray nozzle at the top, whereas the concentrate will not, but that is something to always double-check.

Now, we've used this cleaner for just about everything. It's not abrasive, it is safe to use on virtually all surfaces, so I've used it to clean floors, used it to clean walls, used it to clean countertops, anywhere in our kitchen, bath, flooring, you know, for kids making a mess in the living room. We have used this product on it, and it has worked well. Now, it's not going to be abrasive, so if you're trying to scrub something out, maybe you've got massive stains on something, then this might not be the best product for that just because it's not abrasive. So scrubbing it won't get that kind of rubbing motion that you'll need for cleaning those things. But overall, it does do a good job in cleaning pretty much everything around the house.

It has some simple directions. It says not to use on suede, leather, unfinished wood, opals, or pearls. So pretty much as long as you're not cleaning that, then you are good to go on cleaning it, which most people aren't going to be trying to clean unfinished wood, suede, leather. And I guess opals and pearls are important to keep in mind if you happen to have opals or pearls. But definitely a good all-purpose cleaner to have around the house.
