Wanna hear music like never before? Whoa, you gotta check this out. Very earthy being, oh yeah, very earthy being, oh yeah. What is the people of earth? Welcome to the Earthly channel here on YouTube. You are watching Very Earthly Being. Today we will be unboxing the JBL Tune 510 BT, even though I already opened and used this product. And I'll also give my thoughts, reviews, and honest opinions about these headphones. Now without further ado, let's check it out.

Let's start off with the unboxing. Surprisingly, there is no plastic or any material wrapped around the box for packaging, which is still good and still looks neat. Now let's start taking a look at the box. First up, in the front, we have the JBL by Harman logo at the upper left corner. Hey yo, fun fact, did you know that JBL is owned by Harman International, which is also a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics? Now that right there is some info for you. Anyways, it also says Tune 510 BT here at the right side. We can also see the features such as wireless pure bass sound and hands-free calls. And of course, the elephant in the room, the product's image with some overlapping text that states pure bass and wireless. Well, of course, you can't miss the JBL logo for sure. At the bottom, we can also see the Bluetooth logo and another feature that says 40 hours of battery life, well as long as you started using it fully charged.

Now at the top of the box, we can see the words wireless on-ear headphones which describes the product itself. At the left side, we have the signature JBL photo of a man in the middle of nowhere and of course JBL's tagline, Dare to Listen. Now heading to the right side, we have another image of the Tune 510 BT with some icons indicating the buttons present on these headphones. And guess what? Another feature is that it is voice assistant compatible if you're really into that “Hey Siri” or “OK Google” type of stuff. Now at the bottom, it's just full of details, icons, and text about the product and the company. Now it's getting juicy. Here's my favorite part: at the back of the box, we can see through the product itself whilst portraying the JBL logo, which to me is a great impression right away just giving effort by means of designing the package. Bro, whoever got this idea should really get a raise, you know what I mean? He's out of line but he's right. Anyways, we see the JBL by Harman label and the model of the product again and also some additional specs such as it can connect through Bluetooth 5.0, uses USB Type-C, and five minutes of charging time is equal to two hours of use. Oh wow, they also be doing math here, huh? Plus, there's another JBL man in the middle of nowhere image inside. Pretty cool.

Now enough with the box, let's get on to the real thing.

Inside the box, obviously the headphones along with its USB Type-C cable, but we'll get into that with its specs later. Back here is just a cardboard. Oh, should I say it? Whoops, too late. JBL is a man in the middle of nowhere image.

Shut your mouth, mate. Also a Tune 510 BT text down here. Now I'm actually in shock finding out how many papers are stacked in here, but of course every single page of it is important. Firstly, we have a quick start guide with, again, an image of, oh my god, please stop, not again, a man in the middle of nowhere.

[Music]

We also have a caution and warnings notices, and I have no idea what this is because it's in another language, but it somewhat looks like something for warranty. Correct me if I'm wrong in the comments down below. And lastly, a paper for the JBL global warranty card.

Now all of that aside, let's check out the product itself. The on-ear headphones are laying weirdly, should I say, but it's because they wanted to show it in the packaging.

Now down here is the USB Type-C charging cable with the signature bright orange JBL always used. Now while opening this, I noticed there's some kind of a plastic lid or seal to maybe not shake the product too harshly. So just simply take it out and boom, the Tune 510 BT are now truly yours. On each ear cup, you'll see a guide to make sure you'll wear it the right way with the help of these L and R letters.

Now at the right ear cup, you will see some navigation controls such as the power button, pause or play button, the volume rocker which also can be used to play the next or previous song in your playlist, and a teeny tiny LED indicator to show if the headphones are on or not. Now sliding the ear cup this way will reveal the mighty Type-C charging port. Hey, did you like those vocals? Oh, come on bro, just stop. We're sick and tired of your jump. I am not yet sure why there are holes like this on both sides of the ear cups, but I think it's for air passage because if you didn't know, we also breathe through our ears, my guy. Oh hey, now it's time to check the specs, build quality, and overall experience of these headphones. The JBL Tune 510 BT is, of course, a wireless on-ear headphone. If you want to hear a very natural experience listening to your music playlist all day long, these headphones are perfect for you. The bass surely complements the other sounds present in the audio you are listening to. Now enough has been said, let's talk about the specs and its build quality. The product currently in my hand is the JBL Tune 510 BT with, of course, the black color. Many colors are available to choose from ranging from white, rose, and blue. These headphones feature the renowned JBL pure bass sound. It uses wireless connectivity via Bluetooth 5.0 for high-quality feedback from your devices to the headphones. It has a driver sensitivity of 103.5 decibels, a dynamic frequency range extending from 20 hertz to an astounding 20 kilohertz, as well as an output impedance of 32 ohms. Now to the battery, it has an amazing lifespan of 40 hours which corresponds to 2 hours of usage by just charging it in 5 minutes. Like how fascinating, am I right? With the help of the Type-C charging cable also included in the box, charging this is quicker than ever. The Tune 510 BT also features hands-free calls where you can just simply press a button to maybe answer or end a call and even mute or unmute yourself. The JBL 510 BT has a weight of 159.9 grams and dimensions of 8.07 by 1.89 by 8.78 inches. Now as you can see, it is entirely foldable to make it compact or, you know, maybe just punch someone using this. Now this one just totally blew me away because it also features a clear microphone built inside these headphones. Now for the build quality, I'll say it's a 9 out of 10. The headphone is entirely made out of plastic which is still pretty high quality and still tough compared to other headphones in the market, but you know it's still very durable and can surely last long. Plus who cares when you're looking like Ben Simmons on his pre-game outfit, am I right? Oh, uh, you don't like Ben Simmons? Oh well, about that. The audio quality is so good you can literally feel all the organs in your body bounce, bro. And you know what's better than that? Subscribing to this channel right now helps me a ton in doing these contents and also you'll support the channel. Now for the price, you might get a little bit shocked about this, but it's all worth it, trust me. The JBL 510 BT costs about 65 US dollars or about 3,300 Philippine pesos or 4,800 Indian rupees. Well, overall I rate this product a 9 out of 10. I'll say it's a very great buy, especially for the people who want comfort, style, and quality all in the same headphones, which technically every single one of those is in this product. To buy the headphones, you can order online such as amazon.com, but if you are located in the Philippines, you can get it from Lazada or Shopee and even in JBL physical stores near you wherein I also got mine.

So guys, thank you all so much for watching. Comment your opinion about the product right here down below. I'll see you in the next video. Bye-bye.
