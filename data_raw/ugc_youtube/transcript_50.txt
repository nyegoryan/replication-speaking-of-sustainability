Charging case is not very big. It does feel high quality. It has a matte black finish with the JBL logo right here on the front. On the inside, we have the JBL earbuds, and then there's also an LED indicator right here letting you know the charge status of the earbuds. All right, so these come in a matte black with a gloss finish over the front of them with the JBL logo as well. Then they also have an LED indicator letting you know the connectivity and the charge of the earbuds. You also have a stamp right here letting you know which ear the earbud goes in. This one is the left one, and this one is the right one. Now again, you do have interchangeable tips for these depending on the size of your ear, so that way they fit very comfortably in your ear. They're really comfortable, they're lightweight, and they feel like they're pretty snug in there and they're not going to fall out. So if you're into fitness and maybe you like to wear these to the gym, they won't come out of your ear while you're exercising or running.
