Hi, guys. I'm Nikki with LuckyVitamin, here to talk about my Lucky Pick, Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Multi-Surface Cleaner in Lemon Verbena scent. I love this Mrs. Meyer's cleaning line. Everything in the line is amazing. I use this product in every room of my house. Not just the bathroom, the kitchen, every single room. I have even used it to clean windows, my fridge, appliances, you name it, I've used it to clean it. I have kids, so I'm always worried about food surfaces and, you know, other harsh chemicals. You have to wipe them down again after you use them. This, you don't have to. I don't mind just wiping and going, and I don't have to worry about that.

So, it not only comes in this Lemon Verbena scent, it comes in really cool basil, honeysuckle, lavender, a wide variety of scents that we sell. When the bottle's empty, I buy the liquid concentrate, which also comes in the same scents, and you just put a little bit of concentrate in the bottle, fill it up with water, and there you go, you've recycled your bottle. It's very natural and clean, free of parabens. It doesn't smell like harsh chemicals, so I love that I can clean my house and not get an overwhelming smell of chemicals. That's why I love it. Give it a try. If you love it too, tell your friends, tell your family, and spread the wellness.
