This is the Bath and Body Works White Barn Champagne Toast candle. This is a 14.5 oz 3-wick candle. You get this really nice gold-colored top paired with like a salmon-colored frosted glass jar. The label in the front has some texture on it. There is no label in the back. Underneath, you can find some candle safety information.

My initial impression was a sweet berry aroma; that's very nice. Later in the day, I tried for the champagne, and I finally found that champagne aroma. The label says champagne, berries, and tangerine. I'm a huge fan of 3-wick candles because they release more aroma. Bath and Body Works are my favorite types of candles to buy, and this one did not disappoint. If you're into a berry and light champagne fragrance, check this one out.
