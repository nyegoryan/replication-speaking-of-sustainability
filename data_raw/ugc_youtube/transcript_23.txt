Go. Everyone today we're opening a candle by company called Capri blue. It's one of my favorite candles, and the scent is called volcano. So this is the package. It comes in, Capri blue scented candle I'm Capri blue volcano. I don't know what the six means, but I and this is the same candle that they burn in anthropology stores. 19 ounces. Smells so good. Wish you all could smell this first burn, definitely most critical. Got to make sure it's all even and burn it for a few hours, or else you'll mess up, like I've done in the past and get an uneven candle burn. But yeah, first bird definitely most critical. Yeah, it's definitely one of my favorite candles of all time. So volcano blue, sorry, Capri blue, volcano, great.
