Recycling & Sustainability
Recycling and Upcycling 
How you can help–because it feels good to do good

Upcycle
There are so many things you can do with your candle jars when you’re done enjoying your fragrances. Try turning empty jars into pen holders, vases, idea containers, decorative lanterns, and anything else you imagine. Visit our Inspiration page for more tips and ideas!

Curbside Recycling
Many of our fragrance products can be easily recycled when you’re done with them. Add candle jars with wax removed (no lids, please) to your curbside recycling according to your local guidelines.

 
Mail to TerraCycle
We’ve partnered with TerraCycle® to make 100% of our used fragrance products recyclable through a free shipping program. Visit our TerraCycle® page to find out more.

 
Sustainability
Our commitment to sustainability

At Yankee Candle, we are committed to delivering distinctive products and experiences in a sustainable and socially responsible way for our customers, communities, and employees — now and for generations to come.

We are achieving this vision by focusing on:

Our responsible use of energy
Minimization of waste and identification of recycling and reuse solutions
Partnerships with responsible suppliers 
Providing more sustainable packaging and products
 
We are committed to the responsible use of energy through the implementation of best practices, and through strategic partnerships focused towards achieving global energy conservation practices.

Through waste minimization, we are increasing our efforts in recycling and reuse. We consider this to be the process of reworking a given product beyond its intended use or producing a new product from recyclable material. We are proud to partner with companies that recognize the importance of cleaner manufacturing, recycling, solid waste reduction, and other eco-friendly innovations. We are developing partnerships with suppliers based on an open dialogue that fosters improvements in the sustainability of our products, packaging, and services.
 
We are designing our packaging in order to use more recyclable materials and to reduce the impact of our packaging on the environment.
 
As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives, we continue to leverage our expertise to provide the quality and experience that consumers expect while making continuous improvements throughout the entire product life cycle.
 
As global sustainability and environmental awareness grows within our culture, we will do our part to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs.
