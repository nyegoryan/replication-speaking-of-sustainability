Responsible supply chain
Building our products and bringing them to market requires a global network of suppliers, contract manufacturers, and distributors.

Our efforts to thoughtfully engage with our supply chain are an essential aspect of our sustainability program. Not only must we ensure suppliers’ actions align with our values and meet our code of conduct, but our customers are increasingly focused on supplier sustainability performance.

While we are proud of our current initiatives, we are working diligently to mature our existing program and implement ambitious goals for the future.

Our commitment to the environment
We're taking a responsible approach to mitigating our products' impact on the environment. We're continuosly identifying and pursuing opportunities to reduce energy and material use, and limit carbon emissions and waste generation.

It's on us to reduce the impact our operations and products have on the environment. We pursue opportunities to reduce energy and material use, and limit carbon emissions and waste generation. From refurbishing our products to large-scale energy efficiency projects at our manufacturing plant to employee-led efforts phasing out disposable cutlery in our cafeterias, we're always seeking ways to reduce our environmental impacts.

This philosophy extends to our products, which we're bringing to life through a program that refurbishes and certifies returned products to exacting standards for resale on our website. This type of effort boosts resource productivity and eliminates waste, delivers value to our customers, gives the product new life, and keeps waste out of landfills.

Communities
Our people are creating meaningful change in our communities through volunteering, individiual and corporate giving, and elevating STEAM education.
