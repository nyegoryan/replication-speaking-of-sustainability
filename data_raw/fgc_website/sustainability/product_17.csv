ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT 
OUR COMMITMENT
We're committed to providing high-quality cleaning products with a focus on environmental responsibility and human safety. Since 1975, Simple Green has built a legacy of developing new and innovative products that are responsible choices for many generations to come.

THE SIMPLE GREEN STANDARD
We won't compromise cleaning performance. And we believe you shouldn't have to choose between what works, and what's better for the environment.
That's why we develop innovative formulas that are designed and tested to ensure superior performance. We won't produce anything less than exceptional first-rate products you can feel good about using.
We also believe you have a right to know what's in your cleaning products. Which is why we make all our Safety Data Sheets easily accessible to our customers. We're committed to providing the information you need to make the best choices for your family, home, or business.

MOVING TOWARDS A GREENER WORLD
We've always believed that small, everyday choices can add up over time and go a long way towards building a greener tomorrow.
By using US EPA Safer Choice Certified Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner, you're showing support for a brand that shares your values and amplifies our impact. Moving us one step closer to a healthier, less toxic world.

Think globally, act locally.
-Simple Green inventor and CEO Bruce FaBrizio-

PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
Our current product line includes more than 50 different innovative cleaning products for home and professional use. We are committed to doing our part to protect people and the planet, and will continue to develop new products that are responsible choices for generations to come.
We elevate our products by using safer, gentler ingredients whenever possible. In addition, all safety and efficacy claims made by Simple Green have been proven repeatedly by independent laboratories and third-party testing facilities.
In fact, many Simple Green products contain third-party seals and approvals indicating their compliance with relevant health and safety standards.

EGBAR
We value mission driven partners that work with us to create a better environment and push for change where it matters most. That's why Simple Green supports the non-profit EGBAR Foundation, founded by none other than Simple Green inventor and CEO, Bruce FaBrizio.
EGBAR stands for 'Everything is Gonna Be All Right"" and its mission is to support local organizations doing incredible work such as preserving our wetlands, assisting veterans and first responders, and rescuing dogs. Because as Bruce says, ""if we don't step up and take care of our local community, who will?""
EGBAR also empowers youth to make a positive impact on the planet by supporting programs designed to teach young people environment responsibility.
