OUR COMMITMENT TO RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
For the past 40 years, Versace has been leading fashion and reinventing luxury through empowering designs. Today, we are leaning into our leadership and embedding sustainability as a fundamental part of our strategic development for a more responsible, net-positive  future (across climate, nature, and people). Versace is accountable as a business, as a part of society, and as a collection of individuals forming part of the biodiversity that shares Planet Earth. 
At Versace, we’re putting into place processes and projects to reach this vision. Targets will be continually assessed to ensure they remain both ambitious and achievable. Together with our parent company, Capri Holdings—we are targeting meaningful change and we commit to remaining open and honest about our journey. Emmanuel Gintzburger, CEO

Diversity, holistically
Since our founding in 1978, diversity has been at the core of Versace. Diversity of people, thought, cultures, expression, and experience continues to be fundamental in making Versace the unique and forward-facing luxury House it is. Taking our values further, we have decided to expand this vision to biodiversity as a whole—to protect, nourish, and help flourish the diversity of all living things on earth—inclusive of all species and people. On our journey to being a more responsible company, in order to protect our planet and the communities living on it, biodiversity is at the core. As we embark on our new ambitious path, we will be sharing our vision, actions, and achievements with you.

Our commitment
At Versace, we are approaching responsible sourcing in a holistic way—considering the entire lifecycle of raw materials and striving to source those that have lower carbon footprints, use less water, create less waste, and support our efforts to protect biodiversity. At the same time, we are focused on positively impacting the people who interact with our products along the way.
We monitor the portfolio of materials that we use in our collections and Atelier to ensure that we have continuous improvement around environmental impact, social responsibility, and animal welfare. Versace is committed to increasing the use of responsibly sourced materials and processes in its products, and we are taking ambitious steps to get there.
We are proactively engaging within our supply chains to ensure rigorous social, ethical, and environmental standards are maintained.

How we define responsible sourcing
Sourcing that minimizes negative impact and strives to have a positive impact on people, nature, and the planet. We prioritize materials and processes that are traceable and backed up by third-party certifications to verify their positive credentials. 
Our current criteria include materials with the following certifications:
Organically-produced materials:
Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)
Organic Content Standard (OCS)
Pre- and post-consumer recycled materials:
Global Recycled Standard (GRS)
Recycled Claim Standard (RCS)
Other responsible sourcing methods:
Responsible Wool Standard (RWS)
Responsible Down Standard (RDS)
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)
Leather Working Group (LWG), Silver or Gold tannery certifications

Looking forward
At Versace, we are designing and implementing creative solutions to facilitate the use of traceable, low-impact, responsibly sourced, and recyclable materials, across our products and collections.
Through increasing supplier engagement, training, and upskilling internal teams on low-impact, responsible sourcing and design, we are laying the foundation for what’s to come.
Our goal is to mainstream these materials within our collections.

Policies and practices: 
We are committed to driving incremental positive impact on people, nature, and the planet beyond minimum compliance requirements.
We developed a social responsibility program that ensures we are setting and maintaining a rigorous standard in our supply chain. Amongst this, we are committed to strengthening the labor protections of our artisans by routinely monitoring suppliers on topics including health and safety, welfare, fair pay, human rights, forced labor, and discrimination.
We have restricted the use of certain high-impact and ethically challenging materials, like animal fur, for example.
We have developed Responsible Sourcing Internal Guidance for our sourcing, product development, and design teams, to support them in making the most effective choices, daily.
Our Sustainability, Communications, and Digital departments work closely together to ensure accurate information is presented for each of our products. We have improved and streamlined communications to enable accurate, effective communication with our stakeholders.
We are tracking the percentage of responsibly-sourced styles in each of our collections—those containing over 50% responsibly sourced materials (as defined above) by weight, to benchmark our progress internally and guide improvements.
We’ve embarked on a journey, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you.
