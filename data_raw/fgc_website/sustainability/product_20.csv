For a cleaner, healthier world

Sustainability is central to our purpose to protect, heal and nurture in the relentless pursuit of a cleaner, healthier world. Every day, we're fighting to protect our planet and ensure that people across the globe have access to the highest quality hygiene, wellness and nourishment.
By 2030 we want our products to reach half the world with brands that help people live cleaner healthier lives and engage 2 billion people in partnerships that support the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Focusing on what matters most

We're focusing on the social and environmental issues that matter most to people within our company and beyond – from customers, consumers and communities, to our investors, suppliers and employees.   Identifying the world's most pressing issues and our company’s biggest impacts shapes our strategy, policies and communications, so we can make as big a difference as we can.

Purpose-led brands

We're using the power and reach of our brands, products, programmes and partnerships to have the biggest possible impact on the world's most urgent social and environmental challenges. 

Our approach

Healthier planet

Recognising the connection between healthy people and a healthy planet, we’re battling climate change by protecting biodiversity, using water more efficiently and cutting our carbon footprint.

Fairer society

We're using our position as an employer, as well as our relationship with our partners and suppliers, to build a fairer, more inclusive society for the people we work with across the globe.

OUR GOVERNANCE
Our approach is underpinned by high standards of corporate governance, combined with a rigorous, open approach to reporting. It's how we run our business with integrity and maintain people's trust.

FOCUSING ON WHAT MATTERS
For our sustainability strategy to be a success, it is important that we focus on the most material issues to the company and stakeholders. We work with independent external experts to assess the priority issues for our many stakeholders through focused research and dialogue. This helps us understand how to allocate resources and partner for the maximum impact, as well as how to shape our culture to make a real difference in the areas that matter most.

Our starting point in addressing sustainability is establishing what matters most to both internal and external stakeholders, from customers, consumers and communities, to investors, suppliers and employees.

Our latest materiality assessment results reaffirm the ambitions and associated targets we set in 2021 – purpose-led brands, a healthier planet, and a fairer, more inclusive and diverse society – are relevant to all stakeholders and that our priorities match theirs. They tell us we’re prioritising the right issues: there’s a clear connection between our most material issues, our 2030 ambitions and our business strategy.

BRANDS WITH PURPOSE 
We aim to use the reach and power of our brands and our business as a force for good.

Our brands are all focused on solving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, so we have as positive an impact on society as possible, while minimising our impact on the environment. We're dedicated to improving people’s lives through better hygiene, health and nutrition.
