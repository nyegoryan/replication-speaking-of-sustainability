We believe an investment in our people is an investment in our future.

Our purpose is to make the world a brighter, happier place through the power of fragrance, and that starts with our people. Our more than 57,000 associates across our stores, distribution centers and home offices are the heart of this company. Together, we are Gingham Nation.

At Bath & Body Works, everyone belongs. We celebrate the things that make us different, and we’re united by our shared set of values that guide everything we do. It’s our collective diversity that makes us stronger, and our culture of belonging that empowers each of us to bring our full selves to work every day.

We believe an investment in our people is an investment in our future. For us, it’s about growing in your career and having fun while you do it.

Our purpose goes beyond selling products. More than anything, our customers and the communities we reach power our brand, so when they need help, our associates jump in.

Driving Positive Change
See the progress we've already made and the steps we're taking to reach our goals for a healthier planet.

Packaging and Plastics
We are changing the way we approach the packaging in our products.

This involves not only identifying sustainable packaging solutions, but also ensuring the quality and durability our customers depend on. A key consideration also included in our approach will be communication with customers about how to properly dispose of our packaging. This will take significant work, but we are committed to meeting the challenge head-on. 

Better Packaging on the Horizon

We are building on our current work to reduce the footprint of our packaging using 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging across our product portfolio by 2030, with a near-term focus on embracing circular packaging solutions to decrease the use of virgin plastic. By increasing our use of post-consumer resin instead of virgin plastic, we can reduce the amount of plastic that goes to landfill, reduce fossil fuels usage in the manufacturing of new plastic products and support recycling programs. All of these actions will help us achieve our sustainability goals and limit negative impact on the environment. 

We’re proud of the progress we made in 2023 against our packaging and plastics commitments, including:
Incorporating ESG into supplier conversations and exploring opportunities for PCR and post industrial recycled (PIR) materials where possible. 
Seizing opportunities to introduce PCR at various levels into the primary packaging for new products, like with the launch of our new laundry care collection.  
Exploring refillable product expansion in the future.  
Retaining external expertise to better understand the evolving regulatory/legislative landscape related to packaging and plastics and have thought partnership in the development of forward-looking strategies to meet/exceed these requirements where applicable. 
Conducting an end-to-end recyclability assessment with Resource Recycling Systems (RRS) on our five key product forms, which was used to influence the action plan in our ESG roadmap for packaging and plastics commitments.  
Retaining learnings from our pilot customer take-back program to reimagine a future program that more closely aligns to our holistic business strategy.

Climate Change and Carbon Emissions
As a global business, we recognize the role we can play in helping to combat climate change. We are committed to taking significant steps forward to measure and make reductions on the emissions stemming from our operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and within our entire value chain (Scope 3).

Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions

While our Scope 1 and 2 emissions are a small portion of our carbon footprint, we are committed to achieving emissions reductions in activities that fall within the realm of our direct control. As we work to achieve 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030, our teams are continuing to identify and pursue opportunities to be more efficient with energy and fuel use.  

Scope 3 Emissions and CDP Climate Reporting

We estimate that the bulk of our emissions stem from our extended value chain (Scope 3). That's why we have reported several categories of our indirect emissions (Scope 3) to CDP since the mid-2000s (as part of L Brands until 2021) and are expanding measurement to all relevant Scope 3 emissions categories in alignment with our commitment to set reduction targets for our entire value chain by 2025.

Sustainable Sourcing
Every step of the product’s journey matters as we work to create a brighter and happier planet.
We are committed to working toward ensuring that our materials are sourced in a way that reduces the environmental impact where possible.

Sourcing Sustainable Paper
We’re proud to continue our commitment to the sustainable sourcing of paper and other forest product supplies, such as cardboard. In line with our Forest Products Procurement Policy, we diligently endeavor to avoid products that contribute to deforestation or human rights abuses. We look forward to continuing our efforts to introduce recyclable paper solutions and identify further opportunities to reduce paper consumption where appropriate.  

Waste and Water Management
It's important to us to be good stewards of the environment and good neighbors in our communities around the world.

We're committed to preserving resources for future generations – and as such, we carefully review our operations for safety and compliance and look for ways to reuse materials or do more with less.

Waste and Recycling

We follow strict standard operating procedures and policies for the management of waste to ensure safe and compliant recycling, transport and disposal. This includes waste generated by our operations in offices, distribution and fulfillment centers and stores as well as company-owned inventory (e.g., packaging components, etc.) at third-party vendors when and where it requires disposal. Where we have direct control, we work with an extensive network of recycling and disposal partners while some stores’ waste and recycling services are managed by vendors contracted directly through our mall landlords.

We also continuously work with our teams and external recycling partners to identify economically viable outlets to reuse and recycle the materials from our operations.

Water

We recognize the significance of water as a natural resource and the critical need to safeguard it. As a business, we interact with water in a variety of ways. At our own operations, it’s part of our environmental footprint as we use water in our field stores and home offices (in bathrooms, demonstration sinks, kitchens, chillers, etc.). We also use water as an ingredient in products, and, through our sustainable sourcing risk assessment tool, identified it as one of our priority ingredients as we work to focus our sustainable sourcing strategy in the future.

In 2023, we took initial steps to set the foundation for our future water program. We partnered with EDF to conduct a water assessment and measure our direct water usage footprint. Overall, the findings validated that a majority of our direct and ingredient water use is in and around Columbus, Ohio, the water basins of which are considered ‘Medium to High’ Baseline Water Stress according to the WRI’s Aqueduct tool. While our central business functions are not located in a water-scarce part of the country, some of our stores and fillers are. We now have our baseline to reference as we build a more robust water program in the future.

As we look ahead, we will continue our assessment of water interactions and look forward to solidifying our water strategy in the near future.
Good360 Partnership Impact

We piloted a new initiative in 2023 for seasonal products in our stores that are marked-out-of-stock (products unable to be sold to customers, e.g., end of season products). Through engagement with our associates around our new ESG strategy, we identified an opportunity to reduce our environmental impact while simultaneously creating positive social impact by donating these products to local nonprofits. A cross-functional team worked to develop, align and execute a pilot as proof-of-concept to collect, transport and donate this product to local nonprofits. This included negotiating with external transportation partners, creating new in-store operating procedures and working with our community and philanthropy team to identify Good360 as our nonprofit partner who could find donation outlets across our various markets. We started our pilot in March 2023 with a group of 20 stores across three geographically diverse markets and expanded the pilot in August 2023 by 10 stores to a total of 30 stores and our distribution and fulfillment centers. Through the pilot, more than 400,000 units of product were donated during 2023. Based on the success of this initial pilot program, it’s now on its way to being scaled toward chain-wide adoption.
