Apple 2030
A plan as innovative
as our products.
We are committed to protecting the planet.
And designing products you love. Apple 2030 is our plan to do both.
By focusing on recycled and renewable materials, clean electricity and low-carbon shipping, we’re working to bring our net emissions to zero across our entire carbon footprint.
We’re sharing our progress — and the work that remains — so you can join us on this journey.
A detailed approach.
From design to disassembly.
Design and Source
Design our products with recycled and renewable materials.1
Our Approach
Recycled and renewable materials often carry a lighter footprint than mined materials. By sourcing more recycled and renewable content, we can help to one day end our reliance on mining.
Our Progress
22% of the materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled and renewable sources.2
Make
Source all manufacturing electricity from clean energy.
Our Approach
Most of our carbon footprint comes from the electricity used to manufacture our products. So our suppliers are transitioning to electricity generated from solar, wind and other renewable sources.
Our Progress
Over 320 of our suppliers have already committed to using 100% renewable electricity by 2030.3
Package and Ship
Package and ship our products with less emissions.
Our Approach
We’re eliminating plastic from our packaging and making it more compact.4 And we’re prioritizing low-carbon shipping methods such as ocean, rail and electric vehicles.
Our Progress
More than 97% of our packaging is now fibre-based.5
Use
Match 100% of our products’ energy use with clean electricity.6
Our Approach
We’re investing in global renewable energy projects that help address the electricity our products use. And we’re making these devices even more energy-efficient.
Our Progress
We’re matching 100% of the expected electricity use for Apple Watch models by investing in projects like the IP Radian Solar project.7
Recover
Maximize the materials we recover from recycled products.
Our Approach
We’re creating technologies, such as our disassembly robot Daisy, to recover critical materials so they can be recycled and reused.8
Our Progress
In 2023, we recycled nearly 40,000 metric tons of electronic materials.9
Our progress by the numbers.
We introduced our most significant product emissions reductions to date with the 2023 Apple Watch lineup.
Over 55% reduction in CO₂e emissions across our carbon footprint since 2015.
18.5M metric tons of CO₂e emissions avoided through our Supplier Clean Energy Program in 2023.
22% of materials shipped in our products came from recycled and renewable sources in 2023.
12.8M devices and accessories sent to new owners for reuse in 2023.
20% reduction in product transportation emissions compared to 2022.
The proof is in our products.
The same innovative thinking that goes into creating the products you love goes into our environmental initiatives. And as we design our products, we’re also using smarter chemistry to make sure they’re safer for everyone who assembles, uses and recycles them.
