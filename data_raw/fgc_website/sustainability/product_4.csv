Our Environmental Responsibility
At VS&Co, we believe in doing what’s right in our industry, our community and our world. To drive our work forward, we are evaluating and setting quantifiable targets aligned to our most material environmental issues—greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, sustainable packaging and sustainable products— to hold ourselves accountable and measure our progress. We are also engaging with experts, academics, peers and industry associations to advance our efforts in partnership with the broader industry.

Forest Products

Victoria’s Secret & Co. is committed to responsible sourcing of forest products. Our Forest Products Procurement Policy is written to reduce threats to ancient and endangered forests and to avoid products that contribute to deforestation or human rights abuses. We are committed to working with our suppliers to source forest products from certified forestry operations, preferably those that meet Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards.

Paper

In order to minimize our impact to the world's forests, we work with our suppliers to source paper products that include recycled content and/or are produced with pulp from certified forestry operations, preferably that meet FSC standards. Listed here is a summary of our commitments and the progress we've made.

Victoria’s Secret & Co.’s Forest Products Policy:

Addresses the entire paper and forest products lifecycle; and
Eliminates suppliers sourcing from endangered forests.
We are committed to:

Not accepting paper sourced from endangered forests;
Optimizing the use of FSC and Post-Consumer Waste (PCW) paper.
To demonstrate our commitments, we:

Phased out paper procured from endangered forests; and
In partnership with L Brands, contributed more than $1 million for research and advocacy related to protecting endangered forests.
Man-Made Cellulosic Fibers

We are increasing the percentage of man-made cellulosic fibers in our portfolio, including rayon, viscose, modal and lyocell. We work with our suppliers in an effort to ensure that we do not knowingly source fabrics from old-growth or endangered forests or sources that contribute to deforestation or the loss of high conservation value forests. 

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (GHG)

We recognize that the retail industry and its supply chain are significant contributors to climate change. How we manage impacts of climate change provides both a risk and opportunity for our organization. We are committed to understanding the impact of our products and operations throughout the entire value chain — from raw materials to end of life — to take meaningful action to reduce our footprint. 

In May 2022, we established a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Task Force — representative of key stakeholders in our facilities, sourcing, supply chain, logistics, operations, finance, audit, legal and ESG teams — to collect our 2021 GHG emissions inventory, understand climate risks and opportunities to our organization and to analyze our emissions across the value chain. Included in our 2023 ESG Report is our FY2022 emissions data, including Scopes 1, 2 and 3. This inventory represents the first full year of our operations as a standalone company.

This data has been validated by a third-party auditor, Apex Companies, LLC (Apex). The verification declaration letter from Apex can be found here. VS&Co is wholly responsible for the determination and presentation of the following greenhouse gas emissions data. 
 

Addressing Emissions in our Supply Chain

We regularly and proactively engage with our supply chain partners to understand their plans, progress and obstacles for reducing their emissions, and we encourage them to set their own targets.


An important step in lowering the environmental impact of our products is collaborating
with supply chain partners to improve manufacturing operations. Toward this aim, we are taking collective action with the Apparel Impact Institute’s Carbon Leadership Program (CLP). This program assists our supply chain partners in measuring their GHG emissions baseline, setting reduction targets, and creating a detailed roadmap for accomplishing those targets – and we’re proud to help sponsor them through this work. Helping to support our partners’ greenhouse gas reduction strategies is key to reducing the environmental footprint of our value chain. 

TRANSPORTATION

The movement of freight around the world requires the use of fossil fuels, and we work with some of the leading logistics companies in the world to efficiently transport our goods using a variety of means. In order to minimize the impact of our supply chain logistics on the environment, Victoria’s Secret & Co. is committed to:

Utilizing the most efficient means of transportation that meets our delivery needs and schedules; and
Utilizing highly efficient trailer stacking techniques to optimize the use of trailer space and reduce the number of trucks and amount of energy required to transport our merchandise to our distribution centers.
BEAUTY SUPPLY CHAIN

We have longstanding partnerships with our beauty vendors with many located on one campus, the Beauty Park, in New Albany, Ohio. Over 40% of our finished goods and components are produced within the Beauty Park.  As of today, the 200-acre site is the home of 14 inter-connected personal care and beauty product vendors, including:

personal care and beauty product manufacturers
packaging component manufacturers,
product fillers
packaging companies
By vertically integrating the entire personal care product supply chain from beginning to end, Victoria’s Secret & Co. is able to shave both time (both production and transit time) as well as distance from our production process. Additionally, the reduction in the transit distance reduces the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacture of our products.

PARTNERING TOWARD IMPROVEMENT

We’re especially proud to partner with suppliers that share our values and commitment to our community and the environment through responsible manufacturing practices.

Brandix Group is another Victoria’s Secret & Co. partner that shares our values and demonstrates a deep commitment to the environment. Through its support of the Green Building Council’s “Go Green” Campaign where it has manufacturing operations in Sri Lanka, Brandix is dedicated to raising awareness on the importance of environment protection and sustainable, practical solutions. Consistent with this commitment to environmental sustainability, Brandix built the first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum-rated apparel factory under the Green Building Rating System of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and obtained LEED certification for three additional facilities. In addition, Brandix installed the largest rooftop solar plant in Sri Lanka as part of their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.

By developing its own assessment tool - Eco Index, Brandix is able to quantify reductions in key environmental indicators for air, water and earth as they rollout initiatives to all of their locations in an effort to minimise CO2 emissions, energy and water consumption and solid waste disposal.

We’re also thrilled to highlight our partner, MAS Holdings. Our unique partnership with MAS Holdings has led to groundbreaking progress on the Forever Bra, which features our first bra pad designed for circularity. For over three decades, MAS has set out to reimagine the way the industry approaches manufacturing. At its core, MAS is committed to inspiring sustainable change in a way that works toward climate resilience, enriches lives and drives innovation that fuels positive change.

Packaging
Packaging is critical for protecting and transporting our product, as well as supporting our customer’s shopping experience. We recognize, however, that packaging is a significant contributor to our waste generation and emissions.

With a comprehensive view of our impact levers, we aligned on principles to guide our packaging sustainability strategy and established a target to hold ourselves accountable and track progress. Our first priority is to eliminate unnecessary packaging. For essential packaging, we focus on five principles to improve our environmental impact: weight-optimized, mono-material, fully recyclable, reusable and free of virgin content. By 2030, our goal is for 75% or more of packaging across all packaging categories to be designed with at least one eco-design principle and use at least 50% PCR.

We also joined the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, an industry group to continue learning from others, share our learnings and collaborate with peers to drive action.

Packaging Reduction and Optimization 
We are continually researching and testing new packaging options that reduce the amount of packaging components and materials required to produce, ship, protect and dispense our product. Here are examples of our process to date: 

Implemented rolling techniques for bulky products at the vendor to reduce the amount of corrugate needed and improved transportation efficiency by allowing for more products to be shipped in the same space.
Reduced the amount and bulk of packaging used to house and ship e-commerce orders, helping to eliminate unnecessary components while maintaining high quality for transportation. 
Increased manufacturing efficiency, and in turn, reduced the number of components that are produced as scrap.
Reduced weight of primary beauty packaging.
Design for Recovery and Recyclability

We are committed to evaluating packaging options with their end-of-life destination in mind, to reduce our contribution to packaging waste, where possible. In partnership with our suppliers, we continue to explore packaging options that are designed to be recycled
or reused. Here is an update on our work underway:


What we’re doing: Decreasing virgin content and increasing recycled content. Why: This supports the circular economy, keeping materials in use for longer. When recycled materials are not available due to supply chain or product durability issues, we prioritize using certified alternative materials (i.e., Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper).

What we’re doing: Designing mono-material packaging. Why: Packaging composed of at least 90% of the same material can better enable recycling options at end-of-life.

What we’re doing: Designing our packaging to be recyclable. Why: Utilizing materials that are compatible with current recycling systems globally, as well as designing packaging to be separable at its end-of-life, are the first steps to contributing to a circular economy.

What we’re doing: Optimizing the weight of our packaging. Why: Eliminating unnecessary packaging components, consolidating packaging items where possible and light-weighting essential packaging products are key to minimizing the overall environmental impact of our packaging.

What we’re doing: Designing our packaging to be reusable. Why: Reuse allows packaging to stay in use longer and  reduces our packaging needs.

Water and Chemical Management 
At Victoria’s Secret & Co. (VS&Co) we recognize that our planet is our greatest asset, and we are committed to reducing our footprint across our supply chain by working closely with industry groups and our suppliers to institute best practices in environment management.

As part of this commitment, we’re proud to partner with several industry-leading organizations like, Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) to help us reduce water and energy consumption and waste generation, the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemical (ZDHC) and Apparel and Footwear RSL Management (AFIRM) groups to help us improve chemical management and eliminate pollution discharge and Textile Exchange to help us improve the sustainability of our materials.
