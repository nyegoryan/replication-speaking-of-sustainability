Chesapeake Bay Candle A fragrance-filled journey into wellness for the mind & body.
Inspired Beginnings
In 1994, Mei Xu and David Wang started out making candles by hand in the basement of their Annapolis home. Inspired by the beauty of the nearby Chesapeake Bay shoreline, they named their fragrance brand Chesapeake Bay Candle.
