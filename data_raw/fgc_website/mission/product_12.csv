Our Values
We believe that business, at its best, serves the public good, empowers people around the world, and binds us together as never before. - Apple CEO Tim Cook
We are committed to demonstrating that business can and should be a force for good. Achieving that takes innovation, collaboration, and a focus on serving others. It also means leading with our values in the technology we make, the way we make it, and how we treat people and the planet we share. We’re always working to leave the world better than we found it, and to create powerful tools that empower others to do the same.
Apple Values Summary  
We have a wide range of reports and websites that outline key progress across each of our values and other key topics. We’ve also mapped our disclosures across metrics outlined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB), now managed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the IFRS Foundation, and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) voluntary disclosure frameworks, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
