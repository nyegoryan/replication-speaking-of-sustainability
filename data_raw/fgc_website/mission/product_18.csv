About Us
From our garden-inspired scents to our garden-inspired values, we’re on a mission to grow something bigger.

Uplifting scents, down-to-earth values.
At Mrs. Meyer’s, we’ve always been inspired by the garden.​ From our uplifting scents to our down to earth values,​ we believe the garden can grow something bigger.​ So everything we do, from our hardworking products,​ to our responsibly sourced ingredients, to being a good neighbor, takes its cue from the goodness right in our own backyard.​

What we make
For generations we've had to put up with conventional ingredients and sterile smells to get a good clean. To that we said, Enough is enough. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day: A collection of household products inspired by flowers and herbs that smell delightful, all while packing a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden-inspired scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil and many more. Spoiler alert: These products work hard and make every task, big or small, smell oh so wonderful.

Rooted In Goodness
Made with plant-derived ingredients, essential oils and other thoughtfully formulated ingredients, our products work hard against dirt and grime but they’re absolutely delightful to use. Our wonderful scents brighten days and bring all the loveliness of the garden inside. Because cleaning ought to inspire, energize and put smiles on our faces. If you ask us, at least.

Smells like a garden. Cleans like the dickens.
We work hard to ensure that our products are made with a responsible combination of ingredients—ingredients that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but fill your home with garden-inspired scents that smell delightful.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, we obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy and olive. Keep in mind that sometimes we opt not to use a plant-derived material for reasons related to efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products are made without ammonia, chlorine, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from palm oil are members of Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices in eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America, like the Brazilian rain forests.
Mrs. Meyer's products are made with cruelty-free formulas and are Leaping Bunny certified.

Growing a More Compassionate World
Here at Mrs. Meyer’s, we've always believed the garden has the power to do a whole lot more than inspire thoughtful home and personal care products: it can inspire thoughtfulness in people, too. Our roots in growing garden-inspired goodness are years in the making.​
Years ago we worked with horticulturalists at Ball Horticultural to create the Compassion Flower, a first-of-its-kind hybrid between the pansy (pensamiento in Spanish, which means 'to think of' or 'to consider') and the spreading viola. The result: a flower symbolizing that just like a plant, any act of kindness can grow and spread. Inspired by the cheery, uplifting scent of our new floral hybrid, we created our Compassion Flower product line to serve as a daily reminder that, just like washing your hands, practicing compassion and kindness is a good daily habit.
Let's grow a more compassionate world. What good will the garden inspire in you? ​
