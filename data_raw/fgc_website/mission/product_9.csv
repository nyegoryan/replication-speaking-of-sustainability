Whether it’s a 3-wick candle or a fine fragrance mist, we’re constantly advancing so we can continue giving our customers the unique Bath & Body Works experience they love. In fact, a key ingredient to our success is our ability to artfully innovate a single fragrance into numerous forms, giving our customers their favorite scent in their favorite form.
It’s this unparalleled passion for fragrance and commitment to innovation that drive our business forward. Our predominantly U.S.-based supply chain, combined with our best-in-class distribution partners, enhances our competitive edge.
