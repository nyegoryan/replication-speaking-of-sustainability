Versace is one of the most recognizable names in the world. The luxury House immediately became a leader in fashion and culture following its founding in 1978 by Gianni Versace, and it continues to lead with purpose under the creative vision of Donatella Versace and leadership of Emmanuel Gintzburger. Versace's energy comes from its clash of irreverent references. The tension between classical and contemporary; Italian tradition with the latest innovation; rock music with royalty; myth with today’s celebrity stardom. This unique formula shapes a creative culture that is expressed through now iconic designs, world-leading imagery, true fashion moments, and a heritage of innovative Italian artisanship. The Versace name is identified with a lifestyle and attitude that celebrates uniqueness and the power of a person who feels the ultimate freedom to be themselves. The Versace lifestyle includes women's, men's, and children's ready-to-wear, shoes, bags and accessories, Atelier Versace haute couture, eyewear, fragrances, watches, Palazzo Versace hotels, Versace Home homeware, and the Versace Jeans Couture youth line. Versace has a network of 230 boutiques and 638 licensed stores worldwide.
