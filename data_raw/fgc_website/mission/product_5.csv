Our story began in 1983 with one clear vision: to create nautical-inspired, quality pieces that allow people across the world to realize and experience the joy of the water. Starting with only six outerwear pieces, Nautica grew into a renowned global lifestyle brand with over 35 categories in more than 65 countries.
