Sound has the power to transport us. Transform us. To make us feel alive
At Bose, we believe sound is power. It’s the most powerful force on earth. And we’ve dedicated ourselves to improving it for nearly 60 years. Ever since our founder, Dr. Amar Bose, bought a stereo system and thought, “I can make this better,” we’ve been relentlessly pushing forward to the next best thing.

Innovation is more than what we do. It’s who we are — constantly learning and constantly curious. We never stop imagining what better sound sounds like. We’re music fanatics and audio engineers. We’re explorers and inventors and dreamers, passionate down to our bones about making whatever you’re listening to a little more magical. In addition to a long history of ingenuity, we’re proud to be recognized by Fast Company as one of the Most Innovative Companies of 2024.
