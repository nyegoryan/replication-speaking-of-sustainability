OUR STORY The story of Simple Green begins nearly 50 years ago, long before the world gave much thought to using eco-friendly products. 
Simple Green inventor and founder Bruce FaBrizio witnessed a fatal chemical accident while working alongside his father in the 1970s. This opened his eyes to the harmful health and environmental impacts of the dangerous toxic chemicals being used at that time. Bruce and his father knew there had to be a better way.
Bruce developed the initial formula for Simple Green, an effective biodegradable* cleaning product that was safer for humans, animals, and the planet. Simple Green, the Original Green Cleaner was ahead of its time. Powerful enough for the commercial industry, yet safe enough to use at home.
This formula decomposes into elements found in nature within six months after disposal into a typical sanitary sewer or septic system.

FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
Bruce started off as a small, single-van operation selling Simple Green to remove tannic acid from coffee roasting machinery. He then expanded sales to automotive and industrial customers looking for a safe and effective way to remove grease and stains from equipment and flooring.
From these humble beginnings, Bruce grew the Simple Green brand from a one-van show to a global enterprise. Following the death of his father in 1979, Bruce kept the dream alive and renamed the company Sunshine Makers, Inc.
From there he introduced Simple Green to new markets and continued to grow and expand the Simple Green family of products to meet the cleaning needs of household, professional, and industrial customers.
