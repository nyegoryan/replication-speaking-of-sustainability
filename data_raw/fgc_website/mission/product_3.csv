Since the dawn of time, scents have had the unique ability to capture the essence of life’s moments, ingraining them forever in our memory. Wafting gently through the air, they bring back memories of loved ones with emotion and clarity. In 1985, our master perfumer had the intuition to formulate alluring fragrances with human-compatible pheromones: The Original, Pure Instinct’s first pheromone fragrance, was born. Since then, it has empowered individuals to initiate communication with confidence and a positive attitude, bringing interpersonal and romantic relationships to the level of intimacy. Pure Instinct’s Original formula is a proprietary blend of natural ingredients and gender-friendly pheromones. The lightly fragranced oil absorbs quickly and leaves the skin soft to the touch, blending perfectly with your body’s chemistry. Make it your signature scent, and leave a mark wherever you go — a timeless, unforgettable impression. Drawing inspiration from human senses and curated to inspire and rekindle human connections, Pure Instinct is a gateway fragrance to confidence, adventure, and unforgettable experiences.
